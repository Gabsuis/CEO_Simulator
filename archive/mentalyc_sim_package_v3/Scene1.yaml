    setting: "Mentalyc headquarters in Yavneh and remote calls with global therapists and investors."
    briefing:
      short: "You’ve just taken on the CEO role at Mentalyc, an AI documentation startup serving therapists. Your first month is about orienting: assessing reality, meeting every key stakeholder, and clarifying one next concrete milestone beyond proof-of-concept. In parallel you’re expected to set simple CEO infrastructure – calendar discipline, a basic leadership cadence, and lightweight tracking for cash and relationships."
    objectives:
      - "Listen broadly before acting: meet Tech, Marketing, Advisor, early therapists, and the coach."
      - "Clarify the company’s current position across product, customers, finances, and team health."
      - "Define one next external proof point (milestone) with a date and validator."
      - "Establish a minimal CEO operating system: calendar discipline, recurring check-ins, and a simple runway view."
      - "Show honesty about unknowns instead of pretending certainty."

        - "Tech: Hey Boss, welcome aboard. Before we dive into latency charts and HIPAA tickets, what do you prefer I call you—and how detailed do you want my updates?"
      marketing:
        - "Marketing: Hi Boss, I’m Lior. I handle brand and therapist acquisition. What should I call you, and do you prefer quick headlines or more context when we talk numbers and campaigns?"
      coach:
        - "Coach: I’m Eden, your coach on the side of the table that only cares about you as a leader. How would you like me to address you, and do you want brief prompts or deeper explorations in our sessions?"
      advisor:
        - "Advisor: Tal here. I’m your sounding board on runway and the next funding step. What name should I use for you, and how blunt do you want me to be with feedback?"
      therapist_customer_1:
        - "Therapist: I’m Yael, one of your early users. Before we start, what should I call you—and do you want the raw truth about where your product helps and where it gets in my way?"
