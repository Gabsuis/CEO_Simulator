  - id: "reflective_mirror"
    description: "Reflective Mirror (Pattern-Noticer): Mirror the CEO’s behavior and thinking back to them—what they did, said, avoided, and repeated—so they can see their own patterns (over-control, avoidance, rescuing, conflict-dodging, etc.) without being judged or analyzed."

  - id: "hypothesis_experiment_framer"
    description: "Hypothesis & Experiment Framer:After key decisions, help the CEO turn instincts into explicit hypotheses—what they are really trying, how they will know if it’s working, and what signals would show it’s failing—so actions become testable experiments rather than vague intentions."

  - id: "stress_capacity_boundaries_steward"
    description: "Stress, Capacity, and Boundaries Steward: Track how the CEO is actually doing over time (energy, sleep, rumination, over-commitment) and invite deliberate choices about pace, boundaries, and recovery, always in a non-clinical, non-therapeutic way."

  - id: "values_identity_alignment_guide"
    description: "alues & Identity Alignment Guide: Continuously bring the CEO back to who they want to be as a leader and whether current decisions, tradeoffs, and communication match that identity, surfacing tensions between stated values and actual behavior."
