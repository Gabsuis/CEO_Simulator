The Purpose of Prototypes
Note: This is part of the product creator series
of articles, based on the overview article, The
Era of the Product Creator.  This series is
intended for anyone that wants to create a
successful product, whether or not the person
has had professional training or experience in
product management, product design, or
engineering.
Overview
We have been using prototypes since forever, and the book
INSPIRED described the four main types of prototypes in use
by product teams.  Until very recently, the relative costs and
benefits of the various types of prototypes have been largely
consistent for literally decades.
If you’ve been wondering why it is that Figma has been so
successful, they have been the primary tool for the most

popular type of prototypes (“user prototypes”) for several
years.
However, one of the other forms of prototype (“live-data
prototypes”) has historically been more expensive to create,
and required time from developers, so while it was powerful
and essential in certain situations, the cost meant that we only
paid this price when absolutely necessary.
The reason for this article is that this calculus has changed
with the new generation of gen ai-based prototyping tools.
I’m referring here primarily to tools like Lovable, Bolt, and
Figma Make.  
These tools have brought the cost of prototyping in general,
and live-data prototypes in particular, way down to the point
where it can be faster and cheaper than a user prototype, and
this is truly game changing for serious product creators.
But it’s clear to me that many people do not understand the
real purpose of these tools.
Most importantly, these tools are generally not for building
actual products – and they don’t need to be.
The highest order use of a prototype is to help you discover a
successful product.
So what does it actually mean to discover a successful
product?
It means that you have identified a problem worth solving (the
easy part), and then you have managed to discover a solution
worth building (the hard part).
Moreover, it means that the solution you have discovered is
substantially better than the alternatives that currently exist. 
Better enough that people will switch to your solution.

Understanding “a solution worth building” is right at the
foundation of being a successful product creator, which brings
us to the four key product risks.
The Product Risks
Specifically, the solution you have discovered is valuable (the
customer will buy the product and/or choose to use); the
solution is usable (the user can figure out how to do what they
need); the solution is feasible (you have the technology and
the skills needed to build and deliver a product-quality
solution); and the solution is viable (it can work for your
business – you can cost effectively build, distribute, market
and sell your solution, the solution is legal, secure and
compliant with relevant regulations and laws). 
Once you have discovered a successful solution, then actually
building that solution has never been easier or faster, although
that will almost always be done with different tools and
different skills.
Just know that the vast majority of products fail not because
they can’t be built, but because their creators couldn’t discover
a solution worth building. 
In other words, the solution failed to address the risks.
The Purpose of Prototyping
The primary purpose of prototyping is to help discover a
successful solution.
Going from an idea that could potentially solve a problem, to a
prototype of an effective solution is the craft of product.  And
this involves fleshing out the idea, exploring the
consequences and implications, and rapidly iterating on the
solution.
There are many other techniques that are helpful in both
problem and solution discovery, and eventually it’s worth

learning more of them, but far and away, the most important
discovery technique is prototyping, and then using the
prototypes you create to test the risks – before you proceed to
building the actual product. 
The Act of Prototyping
The very act of prototyping helps to flesh out a product idea,
far beyond what we can do in our minds, or in a paper
specification, or in a spreadsheet, or a PowerPoint
presentation.
This is especially true when your product provides a user
experience (either for your external customers or for your
internal employees), but it’s also true when providing a
developer experience (e.g. an API for a platform product).
How Realistic Does The Prototype Need To Be?
Most people know that prototypes are essentially quick and
cheap approximations or simulations of an eventual product.
But this begs the question, how realistic does the prototype
need to be?
There are three primary dimensions to what we mean by
“realistic” (aka “fidelity”):
Visual fidelity refers to how realistic the prototype looks and
feels.
Behavioral fidelity refers to how realistic the interactions are.
Data fidelity refers to whether the data shown in the prototype
is actual data (referred to as “live data”), or just realistic data
(maybe from an earlier point in time, or maybe just made up
data).
Perhaps the most common advice on prototyping is the notion
of “just enough fidelity” – the idea is that we only need the
prototype to be realistic enough to accomplish our purposes,
and no more.

While this advice isn’t necessarily wrong, for most people, this
advice is overly simplistic, and is at the root of so many
misguided conclusions.
The key to understand is that “just enough fidelity” depends
on the particular risk we are addressing.  
“Just enough fidelity” for feasibility is very different for
usability, which is different for value, and when testing viability,
the fidelity needed may be different depending on which
stakeholder you’re testing with.
For example, a CISO (security officer) often needs low visual
and behavioral fidelity in order to assess security and potential
vulnerabilities.  Yet a marketing executive or CEO that is
responsible for the company’s brand may need to see very
high visual fidelity, yet not need high behavioral fidelity.  And a
lawyer often needs very high fidelity across all three
dimensions, depending on the legal consequences.
For a feasibility prototype, often we don’t care at all about
either visual or behavioral fidelity, and in fact an effective
feasibility prototype may not even need a user interface. 
Productizing the Prototype
Once we have discovered a solution worth building, then we
can proceed to build and deliver a production-quality solution
(one that is reliable, scalable, maintainable, performant, and
secure).
Many people refer to the difference as “building to learn,”
versus “building to earn.”
Product discovery is all about building to learn, and product
delivery is all about building to earn.

Once we have the necessary evidence that we have
discovered a solution worth building, we now need to
communicate to the engineers the many details of the
necessary product.
A secondary but still valuable benefit of the prototype is that it
can help serve as a tool for communicating the intended
experience.
Tom Kelly, of the legendary design firm IDEO, argued that “if a
picture is worth a thousand words, then a prototype is worth a
thousand meetings.”
In an upcoming article, we’ll talk about other ways of
describing the intended experience, but for now, it’s important
to understand that the prototype is your go-to tool.
The danger is that many people mistakenly confuse this with
the primary purpose of the prototype.  They want to create an
effective artifact for communication, and they use a
prototyping tool to do this.  But without testing the prototype,
they end up spending the time and money to build a product
that ends up failing in the market.
Thinking Through Prototyping
If you’ve been wondering why top product model companies
are now evaluating a job candidate’s use of these tools during
interviews for product creators, it is because this is how great
products are created.
Building your skills in creating these prototypes, and then
testing these prototypes, is at the very core of product
creation.   The good news is that the barriers to learning and
using these tools have never been lower.
