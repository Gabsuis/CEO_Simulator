by John L. Hennessy, President of Stanford University
I am delighted to introduce this book on technology entrepreneurship by Profes-
sors Byers, Dorf, and Nelson. Technology and similar high-growth enterprises 
play a key role in the development of the global economy and offer many young 
entrepreneurs a chance to realize their dreams.
Unfortunately, there have been few complete and analytical books on tech-
nology entrepreneurship. Professors Byers, Dorf, and Nelson bring years of 
experience in teaching and direct background as entrepreneurs to this book, 
and it shows. Their connections and involvement with start-ups—ranging from 
established companies like Facebook and Genentech to new ventures delivering 
their first products—add real-world insights and relevance.
One of the most impressive aspects of this book is its broad coverage of the 
challenges involved in technology entrepreneurship. Part I talks about the core 
issues around deciding to pursue an entrepreneurial vision and the characteris-
tics vital to success. Key topics include building and maintaining a competitive 
advantage and market timing. As recent history has shown, it is easy to lose 
sight of these principles. Although market trends in technology are ever shifting, 
entrepreneurs are rewarded when they maintain a consistent focus on having a 
sustainable advantage, creating a significant barrier to entry, and leading when 
both the market and the technology are ready. The material in these chapters will 
help entrepreneurs and investors respond in an informed and thoughtful manner.
Part II examines the major strategic decisions with which every entrepreneur 
grapples: how to balance risk and return, what entrepreneurial structure to pur-
sue, and how to develop innovative products and services for the right users and 
customers. It is not uncommon for start-ups led by a technologist to question the 
role of sales and marketing. Sometimes, you hear a remark like: “We have great 
technology and that will bring us customers; nothing else matters!” But without 
sales, there is no revenue, and without marketing, sales will be diminished. It is 
important to understand these vital aspects of any successful business. These are 
challenges faced by every company, and the leadership in any organization must 
regularly examine them. 
Part III discusses operational and organizational issues as well as the vital 
topic in technology-intensive enterprises of intellectual property. Similar mat-
ters of building the organization, thinking about acquisitions, and managing 
operations are also critical. If you fail to address them, it will not matter how 
good your technology is.
Finally, Part IV talks about putting together a solid financial plan for the 
enterprise including exit and funding strategies. Such topics are crucial, and they 
are often the dominant topics of “how-to” books on entrepreneurship. While the

Forewordxii
financing and the choice of investors are key, unless the challenges discussed in 
the preceding sections are overcome, it is unlikely that a new venture, even if 
well financed, will be successful.
In looking through this book, my reaction was, “I wish I had read a book like 
this before I started my first company (MIPS Technologies in 1984).” Unfortu-
nately, I had to learn much of this in real-time, often making mistakes on the 
first attempt. In my experience, the challenges discussed in the earlier sections 
are the real minefields. Yes, it is helpful to know how to negotiate a good deal 
and to structure the right mix of financing sources, especially so employees can 
retain as much equity as possible. However, if you fail to create a sustainable 
advantage or lack a solid sales and marketing plan, the employees’ equity will 
not be worth much.
Those of us who work at Stanford and live near Silicon Valley are in the 
heartland of technology entrepreneurship. We see firsthand the tenacity and 
intelligence of some of the world’s most innovative entrepreneurs. With this 
book, many others will have the opportunity to tap into this experience. Expo-
sure to the extensive and deep insights of Professors Byers, Dorf, and Nelson 
will help build tomorrow’s enterprises and business leaders.

ntrepreneurship is a vital source of change in all facets of society, empow-
ering individuals to seek opportunities where others see insurmount-
able problems. For the past century, entrepreneurs have created many 
great enterprises that subsequently led to job creation, improved productivity, 
increased prosperity, and a higher quality of life. Entrepreneurship is now play-
ing a vital role in finding solutions to the huge challenges facing civilization, 
including health, communications, security, infrastructure, education, energy, 
and the environment.
Many books have been written to help educate others about entrepreneurship. 
Our textbook was the first to thoroughly examine a global phenomenon known as 
“technology entrepreneurship.” Technology entrepreneurship is a style of busi-
ness leadership that involves identifying high-potential, technology-intensive 
commercial opportunities, gathering resources such as talent and capital, and man-
aging rapid growth and significant risks using principled decision-making skills. 
Technology ventures exploit breakthrough advancements in science and engineer-
ing to develop better products and services for customers. The leaders of technol-
ogy ventures demonstrate focus, passion, and an unrelenting will to succeed.
Why is technology so important? The technology sector represents a significant 
portion of the economy of every industrialized nation. In the United States, more 
than one-third of the gross national product and about half of private-sector spend-
ing on capital goods are related to technology. It is clear that national and global 
economic growth depends on the health and contributions of technology businesses.
Technology has also become ubiquitous in modern society. Note the pro-
liferation of smartphones, personal computers, tablets, and the Internet in the 
past two decades and their subsequent integration into everyday commerce and 
our personal lives. When we refer to “high-technology” ventures, we include 
information technology enterprises, biotechnology and medical businesses, 
energy and sustainability companies, and those service firms where technology 
is critical to their missions. At the beginning of the twenty first century, many 
technologies show tremendous promise, including computational systems, Inter-
net advancements, mobile communications platforms, networks and sensors, 
medical devices and biotechnology, artificial intelligence, robotics, 3D manu-
facturing, nanotechnology, and clean energy. The intersection of these technolo-
gies may indeed enable the most promising opportunities.
The drive to understand technology venturing has frequently been associ-
ated with boom times. Certainly, the often-dramatic fluctuations of economic 
cycles can foster periods of extreme optimism as well as fear with respect to 
entrepreneurship. However, some of the most important technology compa-
nies have been founded during recessions (e.g., Intel, Cisco, and Amgen). This 
book’s principles endure regardless of the state of the economy.

Prefacexiv
APPROACH
Just as entrepreneurs innovate by recombining existing ideas and concepts, we 
integrate the most valuable entrepreneurship and technology management theo-
ries from the world’s leading scholars to create a fresh look at entrepreneurship. 
We also provide an action-oriented approach to the subject through the use of 
examples, exercises, and lists. By striking a balance between theory and practice, 
our readers gain from both perspectives.
Our comprehensive collection of concepts and applications provides the 
tools necessary for success in starting and growing a technology enterprise. We 
show the critical differences between scientific ideas and true business opportu-
nities. Readers benefit from the book’s integrated set of cases, examples, busi-
ness plans, and recommended sources for more information.
We illustrate the book’s concepts with examples from the early stages of 
high-technology firms (e.g., Apple, Google, and Genentech) and traditional 
firms that use technology strategically (e.g., FedEx and Wal-Mart). How did 
they develop enterprises that have had such positive impact, sustainable perfor-
mance, and longevity? In fact, the book’s major principles are applicable to any 
growth-oriented, high-potential venture, including high-impact nonprofit enter-
prises such as Conservation International and the Gates Foundation.
AUDIENCE
This book is designed for students in colleges and universities, as well as oth-
ers in industry and public service, who seek to learn the essentials of technol-
ogy and high-growth entrepreneurship. No prerequisite knowledge is necessary, 
although an understanding of basic accounting principles will prove useful.
Entrepreneurship was traditionally taught only to business majors. Because 
entrepreneurship education opportunities now span the entire campus, we wrote 
this book to be approachable by students of all majors and levels, including under-
graduate, graduate, and executive education. Our primary focus is on science and 
engineering majors enrolled in entrepreneurship and innovation courses, but the 
book is also valuable to business students and others with a particular interest in 
high-growth ventures.
For example, our courses at Stanford University, the University of Oregon, 
and the University of California, Davis, based on this textbook regularly attract 
students from majors as diverse as computer science, product design, political 
science, economics, pre-med, electrical engineering, history, biology, and busi-
ness. Although the focus is on technology entrepreneurship, these students find 
this material applicable to the pursuit of a wide variety of endeavors. Entre-
preneurship education is a wonderful way to teach universal leadership skills, 
which include being comfortable with constant change, contributing to an inno-
vative team, and demonstrating passion in any effort. Anyone can learn entrepre-
neurial thinking and leadership. We particularly encourage instructors to design 
courses in which the students form study teams early in the term and learn to 
work together effectively on group assignments.

Preface xv
WHAT’S NEW
Based upon feedback from readers and new developments in the field of tech-
nology entrepreneurship, numerous enhancements appear in this fourth edition. 
Recent compelling academic theories and practitioner insights in entrepreneur-
ship from leading scholarly journals, trade books, and popular blogs and press 
are included in the text. Special attention is given to business model develop-
ment and measurement, lean start-ups, design thinking, intellectual property, 
and marketing and sales. All examples and exercises were reviewed to place 
even more emphasis on exciting technology ventures around the globe. 
Chapters 1 and 2 have been extensively revised to better introduce the art 
and science of venturing. Chapter 3 now contains the latest techniques on busi-
ness model development and lean start-up methodologies. The concept story and 
business plan development materials and tools are consolidated and improved 
in a new Chapter 6 to start Part II. Similarly, a new Chapter 8 consolidates and 
expands content regarding creativity and product development. Chapter 11 is 
solely focused on the vital topic of intellectual property. Chapter 12 now has 
all key material on teams and organizational learning in one place. Two new 
full-length cases regarding clean technology and sustainability are included in 
the appendix. The AgraQuest sequential case in each chapter has been replaced 
with an examination of an exemplary enterprise relevant to that material.  Cases 
no longer in use from previous versions are available on our websites. Some 
reordering of sections within chapters streamlines the remaining content.
FEATURES
The book is organized in a modular format to allow for both systematic learning 
and random access of the material to suit the needs of any reader seeking to learn 
how to grow successful technology ventures. Readers focused on business plan 
and model development should consider placing a higher priority on Chapters 3, 
6, 9, 11, 12, 17, 18, and 19. Regardless of the immediate learning goals, the book 
is a handy reference and companion tool for future use. We deploy the follow-
ing wide variety of methods and features to achieve this goal, and we welcome 
feedback and comments.
Principles and Chapter Previews—A set of 20 fundamental principles is 
developed and defined throughout the book. They are listed in the inside 
front cover as well. Each chapter opens with a key question and outlines its 
content and objectives.
Examples and Exercises—Examples of cutting-edge technologies illustrate 
concepts in a shaded-box format. Information technology is chosen for 
many examples because students are familiar with its products and ser-
vices. Exercises are offered at the end of each chapter to test comprehen-
sion of the concepts.
Sequential Exercise and Spotlights—A special exercise called the “venture 
challenge” guides readers through a chapter-by-chapter formation of a new

enterprise. At the end of each chapter’s narrative, a successful enterprise is 
profiled in a special “spotlight” section.
Business Plans—Methods and tools for the development of a business plan 
are gathered into one special chapter, which includes a thoroughly anno-
tated table of contents. A sample business plan is provided in appendix A.
Cases—Eight comprehensive cases are included in appendix B. A short 
description of each case is provided in Table P1. Additional cases from 
Harvard and ECCH are recommended on this textbook’s websites.
References and Glossary—References are indicated in brackets [Smith, 2001] 
and are listed as a complete set in the back of the book. This is followed by a 
comprehensive glossary.
Chapter Sequence—The chapter sequence represents our best effort to 
organize the material in a format that can be used in various types of entre-
preneurship courses. The chapters follow the four-part layout shown in 
Figure P1. Courses focused on creating business plans and models can reor-
der the chapters with emphasis on Chapters 3, 6, 9, 11, 12, 17, 18, and 19.

Venture Opportunity 
and Strategy
E
ntrepreneurs create new businesses that fuel progress in societies world-
wide. They use innovation and technology to foster positive impact and 
activity in all facets of life. Entrepreneurs identify, develop, and com-
municate the essence of an opportunity that has attractive potential to become a 
successful venture. They describe the valuable contributions of the venture, and 
they design a business model that can adapt to changing circumstances. The ven-
ture team creates a road map (strategy) that can, with good chance, effectively 
lead to the commercialization of the new product or service in the marketplace 
with a sustainable competitive advantage. ■

What drives global entrepreneurship?
E
ntrepreneurs strive to make a difference in 
our world and to contribute to its better-
ment. They identify opportunities,  mobilize 
resources, and relentlessly execute on their visions. 
In this chapter, we describe how entrepreneurs act 
to create new enterprises. We identify firms as key 
structures in the economy and the role of entrepre-
neurship as the engine of economic growth. New 
technologies form the basis of many important 
ventures where scientists and engineers combine 
their technical knowledge with sound business 
practices to foster innovation.  Entrepreneurs are 
the critical people at the center of all of these 
activities.

CHAPTER 1   The Role and Promise of Entrepreneurship4
1.1 Entrepreneurship in Context
From environmental sustainability to security, from information management 
to health care, from transportation to communication, the opportunities for 
people to create a significant positive impact in today’s world are enormous. 
 Entrepreneurs are people who identify and pursue solutions among problems, 
possibilities among needs, and opportunities among challenges. 
Entrepreneurship is more than the creation of a business and the wealth asso-
ciated with it. It is focused on the creation of a new enterprise that serves society 
and makes a positive change. Entrepreneurs can create great and reputable firms 
that exhibit performance, leadership, and longevity. In Table 1.1, look at the 
examples of successful entrepreneurs and the enterprises they created. What con-
tributions have these people and organizations made? What organization would 
you add to the list? What organization do you wish you had created or been a part 
of during its formative years? What organization might you create in the future?

1.1   Entrepreneurship in Context 5
Entrepreneurs seek to achieve a certain goal by starting an organization 
that will address the needs of society and the marketplace. They are prepared to 
respond to a challenge to overcome obstacles and build a business. As Martin 
Luther King, Jr. (1963), said, “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he 
stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of 
challenge and controversy.”
For an entrepreneur, a challenge is a call to respond to a difficult task and 
the commitment to undertake the required enterprise. Richard Branson, the cre-
ator of Virgin Group, reported [Garrett, 1992]: “Ever since I was a teenager, if 
something was a challenge, I did it and learned it. That’s what interests me about 
life—setting myself tests and trying to prove that I can do it.”
Thus, entrepreneurs are resilient people who pounce on challenging prob-
lems, determined to find a solution. They combine important capabilities and 
skills with interests, passions, and commitment. Over nearly a decade, Fred 
Smith worked on perfecting a solution to what he viewed as a growing prob-
lem of organizations to find ways to rapidly ship products to customers. To 
address this challenge, Smith saw an opportunity to build a freight-only airline 
that would fly packages to a huge airport and then sort, transfer, and fly them 
to their destinations overnight. He turned in his paper describing this plan to 
his Yale University professor, who gave it an average grade, said to be a C. 
After he graduated, Smith served four years as a U.S. Marine Corps officer and 
pilot. Following his military service, he spent a few years in the aviation industry 
building up his experience and knowledge of the industry. Then, he prepared a 
fully developed business plan for an overnight freight service. By 1972, he had 
secured financial backing, and Federal Express took to the air in 1973. Federal 
Express became a new way of shipping goods that revolutionized the cargo ship-
ping business worldwide.
Smith and other entrepreneurs recognize a change in society and its needs, 
and then, based on their knowledge and skill, they respond with a new way of 
doing things, typically by recombining people, concepts, and technologies into 
an original solution. Smith saw that the combination of dedicated cargo air-
planes, computer-assisted tracking systems, and overnight delivery would serve 
a new market that required just-in-time delivery of critically important parts, 
documents, and other valuable items. Smith adapted computer technology to 
manage the complex task of tracking and moving packages. More fundamen-
tally, Smith matched his passions and skills as a person with a good opportunity.
An opportunity is a favorable juncture of circumstances with a good chance 
for success or progress. Attractive opportunities combine good timing with real-
istic solutions that address important problems in favorable contexts. It is the 
job of the entrepreneur to locate new ideas, to determine whether they are actual 
opportunities, and, if so, to put them into action. Thus, entrepreneurship may 
be described as the nexus of enterprising individuals and promising opportunities 
[Shane and Venkataraman, 2000]. As illustrated in Figure 1.1, the “sweet spot” 
exists where an individual’s or team’s passions and capabilities intersect with an 
attractive opportunity.

CHAPTER 1   The Role and Promise of Entrepreneurship6
Entrepreneurship is not easy. Only about one-third of new ventures sur-
vive their first three years. As change agents, entrepreneurs must be willing 
to accept failure as a potential outcome of their venture. But, regardless of 
whether the right opportunity has emerged, a person can learn to act as an 
entrepreneur by trying the activity in a low-cost manner. To avoid the realm 
of daydreams and fantasy, a person needs to start the practice of experiment-
ing, testing, and learning about his or her entrepreneurial self [Ibarra, 2002]. 
The would-be entrepreneur should, therefore, engage in this sequence: do it, 
then reflect on it.
The first step is to identify the hypotheses associated with an idea: what 
assumptions is the entrepreneur making when concluding that an identified prob-
lem is really a problem and that a proposed solution is a good and realistic solution? 
Then, the entrepreneur can test these hypotheses by engaging with knowledge-
able individuals, such as potential customers, employees, and partners. Through 
these small experiments, the entrepreneur not only develops contacts and mentors

critical for executing upon an idea [Baer, 2012], but also learns more about the 
opportunity, and what changes may be necessary to make it viable. In this way, 
entrepreneurship is akin to the scientific method, in that entrepreneurs seek to 
gather data in connection with hypotheses, and they refine their ideas based upon 
their findings [Sarasvathy and Venkataraman, 2011]. Put simply, as Y Combina-
tor founder Paul Graham advises, there are three key things necessary to creating 
a successful startup: start with good people, make something that people actually 
want and are willing to pay for, and spend as little money as possible while you 
validate the market and your product acceptance by buyers [Graham, 2005].
If team members identify an opportunity that attracts them and matches 
their skills, they next obtain the resources necessary to implement their solution. 
Finally, they launch and grow an organization, which can grow to have a mas-
sive impact, like those enterprises listed in Table 1.1. The four steps to starting 
a business appear in Table 1.2. Most entrepreneurs repeat these steps multiple 
times as they work to validate an opportunity, making continual adjustments as 
they learn more.
Ultimately, entrepreneurship is centrally focused on the identification 
and exploitation of previously unexploited opportunities. Fortunately for the 
reader, successful entrepreneurs do not possess a rare entrepreneurial gene. 
Entrepreneurship is a systematic, organized, rigorous discipline that can be 
learned and mastered [Drucker, 2002]. This textbook will show you how to 
identify true business opportunities and how to start and grow a high-impact 
enterprise.
TABLE 1.2 Four steps to starting a business.
1. The founding team or individual has the necessary skills or acquires them.
2. The team members identify the opportunity that attracts them and matches their skills. 
They create a solution to match the opportunity.
3. They acquire (or possess) the financial and physical resources necessary to launch the 
business by locating investors and partners.
4. They complete an arrangement or contract with their partners, with investors, and within 
the founder team to launch the business and share the ownership and wealth created.
All entrepreneurs are workers in the world of economics and business. Econom-
ics is the study of the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and ser-
vices. Society, operating at its best, works through entrepreneurs to effectively 
manage its material, environmental, and human resources to achieve widespread 
prosperity. An abundance of material and social goods equitably distributed is 
the goal of most social systems. Entrepreneurs are the people who arrange novel 
organizations or solutions to social and economic problems. They are the people 
who make our economic system thrive [Baumol et al., 2007].

CHAPTER 1   The Role and Promise of Entrepreneurship8
According to Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) researchers, the 
United States maintained about a 12 percent entrepreneurial activity rate between 
1999 and 2011. Thus, one in ten U.S. adults was engaged in setting up or manag-
ing a new enterprise during that period [Phinisee et al., 2008].
These entrepreneurs have had a tremendous impact on U.S. economic growth. 
For example, venture capital funds, which invest in companies led by entrepre-
neurs, accounted for just two-tenths of one percent of U.S. Gross Domestic Prod-
uct in 2012. VC-backed companies, however, accounted for 11 percent of private 
sector jobs and 21 percent of U.S. GDP [National Venture Capital Association, 
2013]. Another 2010 study found that for all but seven years between 1977 and 
2005, existing firms were net job destroyers, losing a combined average of 1 mil-
lion jobs per year [Kauffman Foundation, 2010]. By contrast,  new firms in their 
first year added a combined average of 3 million jobs. Venture-backed compa-
nies such as Amazon, Netflix, Apple, Google, Intuitive Surgical, and Salesforce 
have accounted for tremendous new employment over the past two decades.
An economic system is a system that produces and distributes goods and ser-
vices. Given the limitations of nature and the unlimited desires of humans, eco-
nomic systems are schemes for (1) administering scarcities and (2) improving the 
system to increase the abundance of goods and services. For a nation as a whole, 
its wealth is its food, housing, transportation, health care, and other goods and ser-
vices. A nation is wealthier when it has more of these goods and services. Nations 
strive to secure more prosperity by organizing to achieve a more effective and effi-
cient economic system. It is entrepreneurs who organize and initiate that change.
Almost all variation in living standards among countries is explained by 
productivity, which is the quantity of goods and services produced from the 
sum of all inputs, such as hours worked and fuels used. A model of the economy 
is shown in Figure 1.2. The inputs to the economy are natural capital, financial 
capital, and intellectual capital. The outputs are the desired benefits or outcomes 
and the undesired waste. An appropriate goal is to maximize the beneficial out-
puts and minimize the undesired waste [Dorf, 2001].
Natural capital refers to those features of nature, such as minerals, fuels, 
energy, biological yield, or pollution absorption capacity, that are directly or 
indirectly utilized or are potentially utilizable in human social and economic 
systems. Because of the nature of ecologies, natural capital may be subject to

1.2   Economics and the Firm 9
irreversible change at certain thresholds of use or impact. For example, global 
climate change poses a serious threat to sources of natural capital.
Financial capital refers to financial assets, such as money, bonds, securi-
ties, and land, which allow entrepreneurs to purchase what they need to pro-
duce goods and services. The intellectual capital of an organization includes the 
talents, knowledge and creativity of its people, the efficacy of its management 
systems, and the effectiveness of its customer and supplier relations. The sources 
of intellectual capital are threefold: human capital, organizational capital, and 
social capital. Human capital (HC) is the combined knowledge, skill, and abil-
ity of the company’s employees. Organizational capital (OC) is the hardware, 
software, databases, methods, patents, and management methods of the organi-
zation that support the human capital. Social capital (SC) is the quality of rela-
tionships with a firm’s suppliers, allies, partners, and customers. These elements 
of intellectual capital appear in Table 1.3.
Intellectual capital can be thought of as the sum of the knowledge assets 
of an organization. This knowledge is embodied in the talent, know-how, 
and skills of the members of an organization. Thus, a firm needs to attract 
and retain the best people for its requirements in the same way that it seeks 
the best technologies or physical assets. Knowledge is one of the few assets 
that grows when shared. By organizing itself around its intellectual capital, 
a new firm can leverage its benefits through collaboration, development, and 
sharing.
The economy as portrayed in Figure 1.2 consists of the summation of all 
organizations, for-profit as well as nonprofit and governmental, that provide the 
beneficial outputs for society. These are the organizations that we study and will 
label as enterprises or firms*. Entrepreneurs constantly form new organizations 
or enterprises to meet social and economic needs.
The purpose of a firm is to establish an objective and mission and carry it 
out for the benefit of the customer. Thus, the purpose of Merck Corporation is to 
create pharmaceuticals that protect and enhance its customers’ health. To carry 
out its purpose, each individual firm transforms inputs into desirable outputs that 
serve the needs of customers.

CHAPTER 1   The Role and Promise of Entrepreneurship10
A firm exists as a group of people because it can operate more effectively 
and efficiently than a set of individuals acting separately. Furthermore, a firm 
creates conditions under which people can work more effectively than they 
could on their own. Thus, firms exist to coordinate and motivate people’s eco-
nomic activity [Roberts, 2004]. A firm is more effective because (1) it has lower 
transaction costs and (2) the necessary skills and talent are gathered together in 
effective, collaborative work.
A model of the firm as a transformation entity is shown in Figure 1.3. The 
transformation of inputs into desired outputs is based primarily on the intellec-
tual capital and the entrepreneurial capital of the firm. As an example, consider 
Microsoft, a powerful software firm. It creates and purchases technologies, 
develops new software, and builds a client base. The transformation of its inputs 
into outputs is based on its formidable stock of entrepreneurial capital and intel-
lectual capital.
Entrepreneurial capital (EC) can be formulated as a product of entre-
preneurial competence and entrepreneurial commitment [Erikson, 2002]. 
Entrepreneurial competence is the ability to (1) recognize opportunity, and 
(2) gather and manage the resources necessary to capitalize upon the oppor-
tunity. Entrepreneurial commitment is a dedication of the time and energy 
necessary to bring the enterprise to initiation and fruition. The presence of 
competence without any commitment creates little entrepreneurial capital. 
The presence of commitment without competence may waste both time and 
resources. Both commitment and competence are required to provide signifi-
cant entrepreneurial capital. Thus, we can say that
Entrepreneurial Capital 5 entrepreneurial competence 
 3 entrepreneurial commitment
or
 EC 5 Ecomp 3 Ecomm (1.1)
where Ecomp is entrepreneurial competence and Ecomm is entrepreneurial 
commitment. Note that the symbol 3 is a multiplication sign, but it should be 
recognized that this equation is qualitative in nature.

1.2   Economics and the Firm 11
The accretion of knowledge and experience over time leads to increased 
competence as people mature. However, commitment of energy and time may 
decline when people become less interested in or available for the necessary 
entrepreneurial activities. Both commitment and competence are qualities of the 
leadership team, and they may be complementary qualities shared among the 
team members.
To transform inputs into outputs, the firm also acts to develop, attract, and 
retain intellectual capital. Thus, celebrated wine producer Antinori succeeds 
because of the human capital of its grape growers and wine makers. KFC relies on 
the organizational capital of its recipes and processes. A local café where the waiter 
recognizes you and knows your favorite latté relies on its social capital. Social capi-
tal is based on strong, positive relationships. The firm provides a place where peo-
ple can collaborate, learn, and grow, thus furthering the firm’s intellectual capital.
In fact, the firm’s intellectual capital is critical to its mission and  purpose. 
Figure 1.4 depicts the business theory of a firm, or how it understands its 
total activities, resources, and relationships. First, a firm is clear about its 
mission and purpose. Second, the firm must know and understand its custom-
ers, suppliers, and competitors. Third, a firm’s intellectual capital is under-
stood, renewed, and enhanced as feasible. Finally, the firm must understand 
its environment or context, which is set by society, the market, and the tech-
nology available to it. One hundred years ago, firms were hierarchical and 
bureaucratic with a theory of business that emphasized making long runs of

CHAPTER 1   The Role and Promise of Entrepreneurship12
1.3 Creative Destruction
One view of economic activity describes a world of routine in which little 
changes. In this static model, all decisions have been made, and all alternatives 
are known and explored. But clearly, no economy is static, and change appears 
to be certain. 
Dynamic capitalism is the process of wealth creation characterized by 
the dynamics of new, creative firms forming and growing and old, large firms 
declining and failing. In this model, it is disequilibrium—the disruption of 
existing markets by new entries—that makes capitalism lead to wealth creation 
[Kirchhoff, 1994]. New firms are formed by entrepreneurs to exploit and com-
mercialize new products or services, thus creating new demand and wealth. This 
renewal and revitalization of industry leads to a life cycle of formation, growth, 
and decline of firms.
The recorded music industry provides a good example of waves of change. 
Music lovers listened to their favorite music recorded on vinyl discs until about 
1980, when cassette tapes grew in popularity. The compact size and record- 
ability of the cassette tape caused a massive shift from vinyl records to tape. 
By the late 1980s, however, compact discs (CDs) overshadowed cassettes, due 
to the CD’s better sound quality and instant access to tracks. In turn, the CD 
business peaked in 1995 just as the Internet was gaining momentum in soci-
ety at large. A few years later, peer-to-peer file transfer began to allow piracy 
of music. By 2001, Apple had introduced the iPod and iTunes and eventually 
gained a commanding position in the music distribution and sales business. In a 
dynamic economy, companies need to reinvent their business arrangements or 
end up becoming irrelevant [Knopper, 2009].
Joseph Schumpeter (1883–1950) described this process of new entrepre-
neurial firms and waves of change as creative destruction. Born and educated 
in Austria, Schumpeter taught at Harvard University from 1932 until his death 
in 1950. His most famous book, Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, which 
standardized products. They regularly introduced “new and improved” variet-
ies and provided lifetime employment. Today, firms compete globally with 
high-value, customized products. They use flattened organizations and base 
their future on intellectual capital. Firms look to brands and images to cut 
through the clutter of messages. In the future, a firm’s human capital— 
talent—will become even more important.
One way to look at the future of a firm is as a competition among its 
stakeholders. Flexibility and leanness mostly benefit the firm’s shareowners. 
Stakeholders include not only these shareholders, but also workers, custom-
ers, people in the community, and society in general. Placing a high valuation 
on talent gives more power to the workers. Customers stand to gain power as 
competitors vie for their attention. A good reputation means the firm needs to 
look after its community and society. The entrepreneur in the new firm strives 
to build a firm that serves all its stakeholders well.

1.3   Creative Destruction 13
appeared in 1942 [Schumpeter, 1984], argued that the economy is in a perpetual 
state of dynamic disequilibrium. Entrepreneurs upend the established order, 
unleashing a gale of creative destruction that forces incumbents to adapt or die. 
Schumpeter argued that the concept of perfect competition is irrelevant because 
it focused entirely on market (price) competition, when the focus should be on 
technological competition. Creative destruction incessantly revolutionizes the 
economic structure from within, destroying the old structure and creating a new 
one. The average life span of a company in the Standard and Poors 500 declined 
from 35 years in 1975 to less than 20 years today. Less than 4 of the top 25 
technology companies 30 years ago are leaders today—perhaps only IBM and 
Hewlett-Packard. 
In a world of change, entrepreneurs seek to embrace it. Entrepreneurs match 
ideas for change with opportunity. These changes include the adoption of new 
and better (or cheaper) sources of input supplies, the opening of new markets, and 
the introduction of more profitable forms of business organization.
The profit of the new firm is the key to economic growth and progress. 
By introducing a new and valuable product, the innovator obtains temporary 
monopoly power until rivals figure out how to mimic the innovation. Lower 
costs may give the innovative firm profits higher than those of its rivals, 
which must continue to sell at higher prices to cover their higher expenses. 
Alternatively, a superior product may permit a price above that charged by 
other firms. The same concept clearly fits all forms of successful change. The 
business system works to drive out inefficiency and forces business process 
renewal.
Economic progress is reflected in productivity growth, which provides for 
increases in people’s standard of living. Over the past half-century, the U.S. 
workforce (including immigration) has grown at about 1.7 percent annually, 
and productivity per worker has risen at 2.2 percent, generating real economic 
growth (excluding inflation) averaging 3.9 percent. This is an excellent record, 
due in great part to the impact of technology entrepreneurship.
Rising output per worker comes from two sources: (1) new technology 
and (2) smarter ways of doing work. Both paths have been followed through-
out human history, and they became faster tracks with the coming of the 
Industrial Revolution. The twentieth century started with new techniques of 
management and many new inventions. The century ended with smarter man-
agement techniques and dramatic advances in electronic technology, which 
helped revive productivity growth after limited gains through much of the 
1970s and 1980s.
The free spirit of entrepreneurs provides the vital energy that propels this 
capitalist system. During the past 30 years, the forces of entrepreneurship, com-
petition, and globalization have encouraged new technologies and business 
methods that raise efficiency and efficacy. In recent years, due to competition, 
many of the benefits of strong productivity have flowed to consumers in the 
form of lower prices. Together, innovation, entrepreneurship, and competition 
are important sources of productivity growth.

CHAPTER 1   The Role and Promise of Entrepreneurship14
Little doubt now exists that the economy is driven by firms that capitalize on 
change, technology, and challenge. This book is focused on helping the reader 
to purposefully become an agent of creative destruction by creating his or her 
own firm. An example of an agent of creative destruction is Craig Venter, who 
founded Synthetic Genomics in order to use modified or synthetically produced 
microorganisms to create ethanol and hydrogen. The company is attempting to 
capitalize on the growing interest in alternative fuels and to design and synthe-
size specifically engineered cells to perform particular tasks.
New technologies such as these are often a source of disequilibrium or 
discontinuity, and Schumpeter’s theory was based on disruptive, or “radical,” 
innovations. Technology includes devices, artifacts, processes, tools, methods, 
and materials that can be applied to industrial and commercial purposes. For 
example, Intel was formed to apply semiconductor technology to the design and 
manufacture of semiconductor circuits. Microsoft was formed to create and dis-
tribute computer software products for applications in industry and the home. 
Apple has reshaped itself around mobile communications and mobile media 
technologies.
Modern entrepreneurial firms breed a constant flow of high-impact prod-
ucts that create value and stimulate economic growth by bringing new meth-
ods, technologies, and ideas to the global marketplace [Schramm, 2004]. 
Figure 1.5 illustrates “waves” of innovation based upon different technologies 
throughout history. Modern entrepreneurial firms are at the forefront of the sixth 
wave, which places a special emphasis on sustainability.
Population growth and a worldwide rising middle class, combined with 
tightening energy supplies and fears of climate change, have prompted a move 
toward socially and environmentally responsible business. The goal is to provide 
housing, transportation, and energy systems that use less energy and emit less 
pollution and carbon dioxide. The concept is to use knowledge and innovation 
to create and implement sustainable energy systems and to increase resource 
productivity [Friedman, 2008].
A clean energy system would consist of a mixture of energy generation, 
transmission, and utilization in ways that best use natural resources and mini-
mize environmental impacts. By clean and green we mean a system based 
on conservation, best uses of natural resources, and minimizing environ-
mental impacts. Examples of green technology solutions include installing 
carbon capture systems at power plants, increasing the use of wind power 
systems, and developing high-efficiency biofuel systems. Improving the 
reliability and smart control of the electricity grid also offers a good opportu-
nity for entrepreneurs.
As the green technology movement highlights, technology entrepreneurship 
is based upon intellectual capital. One hundred years ago, successful compa-
nies such as U.S. Steel were primarily managing physical assets. By contrast, 
today’s successful firms, such as Microsoft and Genentech, manage knowledge

and intellectual capital. In fact, for many, if not most, firms, intellectual capital is 
the organization’s most important asset, more valuable than its other physical and 
financial assets. Many firms depend on their patents, copyrights, and software, 
and the capabilities and relationships of their people. This intellectual capital, 
appropriately applied, will determine success or failure. Thus, knowledge has 
become the most important factor of production. 
While innovation and intellectual property are critical, however, a dynamic 
economy ultimately rests on the actions of entrepreneurs who assume and accept 
the benefits and risks of an initiative. It is people acting as leaders, organizers, and 
motivators who are the central figures of modern economic activity. 
Three factors make up entrepreneurial action: (1) a person or group who is 
responsible for the enterprise, (2) the purposeful enterprise, and (3) initiation and 
growth of the enterprise. The individuals responsible for the organization are 
described in Section 1.5. The purposeful enterprise may be a new firm organized 
for a suitable and attractive purpose or a new unit within or separated from an

existing business corporation. Furthermore, the organization may be based on rad-
ical innovation, incremental changes, imitation, or rent-seeking behavior.
In the first type of enterprise, the entrepreneur engages in an innovative activ-
ity that results in novel methods, processes, and products. The second form empha-
sizes the founding and management of a business that builds upon and improves 
an existing product or service. The imitative venture is founded by an entrepreneur 
who is involved in the rapid dissemination of an innovative idea or process. This 
person or group finds a novel innovation and transfers it to another environment, 
region or country. The final means of entrepreneurship is called rent-seeking or 
profit-seeking and focuses on the use of regulation, standards, or laws to appropri-
ate some of the value of a monopoly that is generated somewhere in the economy. 
In this book, we emphasize the creation of the venture that capitalizes 
on technological changes and that will have a significant impact on a region, 
a nation, or the world. A new regulation or clever financial restructuring may 
afford the entrepreneur a new opportunity, but a radical or transforming inno-
vation may provide the entrepreneur with an important opportunity to make a 
productive and significant contribution to the world as we know it.
The critical people at the center of all of these activities are entrepreneurs. The 
entrepreneur is a bold, imaginative deviator from established business methods 
and practices who constantly seeks the opportunity to commercialize new prod-
ucts, technologies, processes, and arrangements [Baumol, 2002]. Entrepreneurs 
thrive in response to challenges and look for unconventional solutions. They 
apply creativity, create visions, and build stories that explain their visions, and 
then act to be part of the solution. They forge new paths and risk failure, but 
persistently seek success. Entrepreneurs distinguish themselves through their 
ability to accumulate and manage knowledge, as well as their ability to mobilize 
resources to achieve a specified business or social goal [Kuemmerle, 2002].
Entrepreneurs engage in eight key activities, as described in Table 1.4. They 
identify and select opportunities that match their skills and interests they acquire 
and mobilize financial, physical and human resources; and they start and grow 
organizations, cognizant of their broader context.
In order to successfully pursue these activities, entrepreneurs should pos-
sess several important capabilities, as noted in Table 1.5. Entrepreneurs are 
opportunity driven and work to find a strategy that can reasonably be expected 
to bring that opportunity to fruitful success. They seek new means or methods 
and are willing to commit to solving a social or business problem that will 
result in success. Entrepreneurs work toward needing shorter time periods to 
decide on an appropriate strategy and seize opportunities. Entrepreneurs have 
a passion to build an enterprise that will solve an important problem. They 
seek ways to express themselves and validate their ideas. They are creative, 
internally motivated, and attracted to new, big ideas or opportunities.
Entrepreneurs exhibit robust confidence, sometimes bordering on overcon-
fidence [Hmieleski and Baron, 2009]. Entrepreneurial innovators tend to exhibit

high self-efficacy—the belief that they can organize and effectively execute 
actions to produce desired attainments [Markman et al., 2002]. They believe 
they possess the capabilities and insights required for the entrepreneurial task. 
Empirically, entrepreneurs with prior experience in the industry in which the 
new venture will be operating perform better, due not only to their related techni-
cal skill but also to their knowledge of marketing and the regulatory environment 
in a sector [Chatterji, 2009]. The best entrepreneurs combine both experience 
and talent [Eesley and Roberts, 2012].
Good entrepreneurs seek to be flexible so they can adapt to changing con-
ditions and reduce the risks of the venture. They are resilient in the face of set-
backs, able to multitask, and exercise well-developed problem-solving skills to 
overcome challenges. Table 1.6 lists some of the elements of this ability.
Finally, entrepreneurs create an overarching vision of the venture and use it 
to motivate employees, allies, and financiers. Perhaps the most important quali-
ties or characteristics of an entrepreneur are the abilities to accomplish the nec-
essary tasks, meet goals, and inspire others to help with these tasks. Successful

CHAPTER 1   The Role and Promise of Entrepreneurship18
entrepreneurial teams attract, train, and retain intellectually brilliant and edu-
cated people capable of multidisciplinary insights [van Praag, 2006]. 
Members of the entrepreneurial team must, therefore, exhibit leadership 
qualities. Leadership is the ability to create change or transform organizations. 
Leadership within an organization enables the organization to adapt and change 
as circumstances require. A real measure of leadership is the ability to acquire 
needed new skills as the situation changes. 
Entrepreneurs vary widely in their backgrounds. Recall the list of entrepre-
neurs in Table 1.1. The age of these people when they launched their enterprises 
ranges from 19 to 43. The median age of all technology-based company founders 
is 39 and many founders are much older [Wadha et al., 2008]. Entrepreneurship is a 
lifelong pursuit that is accessible to people of all ages. Entrepreneurs are also well 
educated. Ninety-two percent of technology entrepreneurs surveyed by the Kauff-
man Foundation hold a bachelor’s degree, 31 percent hold a master’s degree, and 10 
percent hold a Ph.D. At the same time, however, institutions such as the Grameen 
Bank, which lends primarily to women in the third world so that they can start busi-
nesses, have opened up entrepreneurship as a possibility for a wide range of people.
In general, entrepreneurs should have most of the qualities listed in Table 1.5 
in order to participate in a new venture. But, not everyone will have the same 
blend of capabilities. In order to strengthen, diversify, and complement an orga-
nization’s skills, insights, resources, and connections, most entrepreneurs work 
as part of a team.
Moreover, entrepreneurship is an attitude and capability that diffuses beyond 
the founding team to all members of an organization. Most growing firms strive to 
infuse the culture of the entire company with the entrepreneurial spirit. For exam-
ple, Thomas Edison created an enterprise that became General Electric; Steve Jobs 
and Steve Wozniak founded Apple Computer; and Azim Premji started Wipro 
Technologies. These entrepreneurs combined their knowledge of valuable new 
technologies with sound business practices to build important new enterprises that 
continued to maintain their entrepreneurial spirit for years after founding.
Members of an entrepreneurial team decide whether to act as entrepreneurs 
based on the seven factors listed in Table 1.7 [Gatewood, 2001]. Good entre-
preneurs tend to seek independence, financial success, self-realization, validation 
of achievement, and innovation, while fulfilling leadership roles. At the same 
time, potential entrepreneurs evaluate the risk and work efforts associated with an

opportunity and balance them with the benefits. Successful entrepreneurs are able 
to answer positively the five questions listed in Table 1.8 [Kuemmerle, 2002].
Context can have an important effect on whether or not someone becomes 
an entrepreneur [Sørenson, 2007]. For example, people whose colleagues are 
entrepreneurial are more likely to become entrepreneurs themselves [Stuart 
and Ding, 2006]. Similarly, younger and smaller organizations are more likely 
to spawn entrepreneurs [Dobrev and Barnett, 2005]. Work environments with 
an unfavorable innovation climate or a lack of technical-excellence incentives 
can positively influence the entrepreneurial intentions of skilled and ambitious 
employees through low job satisfaction [Lee et al., 2011]. Finally, environmen-
tal changes,  such as an increase in the availability of venture capital financing, 
also affect the decision to become an entrepreneur [Hsu et al., 2007].
On an individual level, people act as self-employed entrepreneurs when that 
career path is felt to be better than employment by an existing firm. Consider the 
satisfaction (utility) derived from an employment arrangement. A utility func-
tion, U, is [Douglas and Shepherd, 1999]:
U 5 f (Y, I, W, R, O)
where Y 5 income, I 5 independence, W 5 work effort, R 5 risk, and 
O 5 other working conditions. It may be assumed that income depends in turn

on ability. People will have an incentive to be entrepreneurs when the most sat-
isfaction (utility) is obtained from the entrepreneurial activity. In other words, 
entrepreneurship pays off due to higher expected income and independence 
when reasonable levels of risk and work efforts are required.
For new entrepreneurial activities, the results of the venture are less known, 
and expected returns, independence, work effort, and risk can only be estimated. 
Potential entrepreneurs must be careful to do an honest assessment of their motiva-
tion and skills [Wasserman, 2012]. Regrettably, many entrepreneurs overweigh the 
benefits of independence and income, and underestimate the work effort required.
Based on the utility function above, we may postulate a utility index that we 
will call the Entrepreneurial Attractiveness (EA) index [Lévesque et al., 2002]. 
For each factor (Y, I, W, and R), we use a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 5 low, 3 5 
medium, and 5 5 high.
 EA 5 (Y 1 I) 2 (W 1 R) (1.2)
As a simple example, consider the straightforward alternatives for a successful 
marketing manager in the electronics industry. She can earn $60,000 annually in 
her existing job (Y in equation 1.2). However, she values the independence of the 
new venture highly (I). The work effort for the new venture is estimated to be the 
same as for her current work (W). However, the risk is higher for the new inde-
pendent venture (R). The potential entrepreneur estimates that she can obtain the 
same income over the next two years, although she will need a four-month period 
with a lower income at the start. The entrepreneur can compare the two options 
across these dimensions as shown in Table 1.9. In this case, over the first two 
years, the benefits of the new venture are Y 1 I 5 8, and the costs of the venture 
are W 1 R 5 7. The benefits of the existing job are equal to 5, and the costs are 
6. Therefore, the EA for the new venture is 11 and the EA for the existing job is 
21. The new opportunity looks more favorable due to this entrepreneur’s desire 
forindependence, and it warrants in-depth analysis.
To mitigate risks, many entrepreneurs transition slowly, retaining their wage 
jobs while entering into self-employment [Folta et al., 2010]. Entrepreneurs 
must be careful, however, to dedicate the necessary effort to a new venture. 
Technology startups are not lifestyle businesses that entrepreneurs can pursue 
with limited hours [Ogle, 2012]. If an idea is not attractive enough to pursue 
wholeheartedly, then it may not be a good opportunity for that entrepreneur.

1.7   Summary 21
In summary, entrepreneurs are multitalented individuals who leverage their 
capabilities and interests to pursue a particular opportunity, almost always with 
the help of a team.* The decision to pursue an entrepreneurial path and a par-
ticular opportunity is determined by weighing the benefits of independence and 
income against the work effort required and the risk of the venture. In Chapter 2, 
we learn how a potential entrepreneur can evaluate an idea to determine if it is 
an actual opportunity.
*Throughout this book, the word entrepreneur will refer to an individual or a team of individuals.
Facebook is a social networking service that was founded in 2004. Harvard Uni-
versity student Mark Zuckerberg and several classmates started the service as an 
online student directory with photos and basic information. Zuckerberg was the 
lead founder and entrepreneur; he attracted other Harvard students to co-found 
and develop the website. In late 2004, Facebook expanded to other Ivy League 
schools, Stanford, and many other universities. That year, Facebook also moved 
its base of operations to California. 
Zuckerberg displayed leadership skills, entrepreneurial commitment, and 
competence. He leveraged innovation and technology to expand his service. 
Zuckerberg’s journey from unknown teenager to dotcom celebrity began 
in the summer of 2006, when he walked away from a billion-dollar Yahoo 
 acquisition offer. He focused on his grand vision of recreating real-world rela-
tionships on the web. Facebook held an initial public offering of stock on 
May 17, 2012 at an initial price of $38 per share, valuing the company at $104 
billion dollars.

CHAPTER 1   The Role and Promise of Entrepreneurship22
 1.1 What is the difference between an idea and an opportunity? Why is this 
difference important to entrepreneurs?
 1.2 Consider opportunities that have occurred to you over the past month 
and list them in a column. Then, describe your strong interests and 
 passions, and list them in a second column. Finally, create a list of your 
capabilities in a third column. Is there a natural match of opportunity, 
interests, and capabilities? If so, does this opportunity appear to offer a 
good chance to build an enterprise? What would you need to do to make 
this opportunity an attractive chance to build an enterprise business?
 1.3 Name an entrepreneur that you personally admire. Why do you consider 
this person to be an entrepreneur? What sets him or her apart from other 
business leaders? What path did this person take to entrepreneurship? 
What personal sacrifices or investments did this person make in the 
 journey? What people were important to this person’s success?
 1.4 Name a successful entrepreneurial team you personally admire. How 
would you classify it in the context of the entrepreneur capabilities 
shown in Table 1.5? Do these elements of entrepreneurship apply to it?
 1.5 Research the number of companies that either had an IPO (initial public 
offering) or have been acquired in the last five years. What industries 
were these companies in? Where is the number of IPOs vs. M&As 
(mergers and acquisitions) trend leading? What implications does this 
have on the number of new ventures being started?
 1.6 Given an understanding of the waves of innovation throughout history 
(Figure 1.5), explore opportunities that are created in a wave after the 
peak. For example, how can an entrepreneur take advantage of a mature 
or declining market?

How can an entrepreneur identify and select 
a valuable opportunity?
T
he identification and evaluation of oppor-
tunities is one of the entrepreneur’s most 
important tasks. Good opportunities address 
important market needs. Examining social, tech-
nological, and economic trends can lead to the 
identification of emerging needs. Entrepreneurs 
seek to build new ventures and to act on a good 
opportunity when it matches their capabilities and 
interests, exists in a favorable context, exhibits the 
potential for sustainable long-term growth, and 
facilitates the acquisition of required resources. 
Such opportunities offer a reasonable chance of 
success and require the entrepreneur to make a 
difficult decision to act or not act. The choice of 
an opportunity and the decision to act is a critical 
juncture in the life of an entrepreneur. With the 
decision to act, the entrepreneur prepares a busi-
ness summary for the venture that is used to test 
the new venture with potential investors, employ-
ees, and customers. Table 2.8 outlines a five-step 
process for evaluating opportunities.

CHAPTER 2   Opportunities26
The first role of the entrepreneur—an individual or a group of people—is to 
identify and select an appropriate opportunity. An opportunity is a timely and 
favorable juncture of circumstances providing a good chance for a successful 
venture. Effective entrepreneurs often find that opportunity identification is 
a creative process that relates a need to the methods, means, or services that 
address or solve it—all within a reasonable period of time.
Opportunities can develop from market demand or from new technologi-
cal possibilities. These opportunities are “demand pull” and “technology push” 
respectively [Di Stefano et al., 2012]. With demand-pull opportunities, an entre-
preneur begins by assessing a need or problem that cries out for a solution. An 
example is the need for a pharmaceutical that can mitigate or cure the effects of 
AIDS. The founders of new industries capitalize on demand pull to create dis-
ruptive innovations that lead to new products that satisfy the demand.
As Vinod Khosla, the co-founder of Sun Microsystems and a well-known 
venture capitalist, is fond of saying, “Every problem is an opportunity.” In turn, 
great opportunities are often disguised as difficult problems. 
An effective tactic for identifying these problems is to focus on situations 
where a potential customer experiences significant “pain,” which represents the 
extent of need for the solution to a problem: a customer who feels significant 
pain of need seeks a high-value solution. For example, in 2011, the World Health 
Organization found that 64 percent of anti-malarial drugs were counterfeit. False 
medications cause pain for the patients, who desire effective treatments, and for 
manufacturers, who desire to get their treatments to patients. Thus, an opportu-
nity exists for companies to track raw materials, manufacturing processes, and 
product shipments in order to validate that a drug is genuine. One such venture 
is called TruTag [Economist, 2012b].
Successful new ventures are often initiated by people who have experienced 
significant painful problems. Sam Goldman, the founder of d.light, grew up in 
Mauritania, Pakistan, Peru, India, and Rwanda before becoming a Peace Corps 
volunteer in Benin. He then moved on to study biology and environmental stud-
ies in Canada before receiving his MBA from Stanford. While Goldman was 
living in Benin, his neighbor’s son was badly burned by a kerosene lamp. This 
inspired him to create a new source of light, which could match kerosene lamps 
on price, but be safe for use around small children. d.light now creates extremely 
efficient LED lights that are 8 to 10 times brighter than a kerosene lamp and 50 
percent more efficient than fluorescent lights.
Once an entrepreneur has identified a problem, he works to develop a solu-
tion. For example, Scott Cook, who founded Intuit, saw a problem experienced 
by individuals who wanted to easily and reliably keep their own home budget 
records, do their taxes, and pay the bills. Cook thought this problem could be 
solved through financial software that was so intuitive that most people could 
use it without resorting to the manual—thus, the name of the firm: Intuit (www.
intuit.com). Entrepreneurs like Cook develop a solution by first asking, “How

would an unconstrained person solve the problem?” Starting without constraints 
such as price and physical limits opens up many possibilities.
Once a good unconstrained solution appears attractive, it can often be rear-
ranged to accommodate reasonable constraints [Nalebuff and Ayres, 2003]. 
Cook solved a big problem with an easy-to-use solution.
Technology-push opportunities might be said to begin with a solution, such as 
the one developed by Cook. The discovery of a new technology, such as HDTV in 
consumer electronics or stem cells in biotechnology, leads entrepreneurs to search 
for ways to apply it. For example, Sandra Lerner and Leonard Bosack formed 
Cisco Systems in 1984 to exploit the capabilities of a router to transmit and trans-
late data to and from disparate computers [Bunnell, 2000]. By 2012, Cisco had 
revenues of over $46 billion.
The power of serendipity—making useful discoveries by accident—can also 
lead to good opportunities. Working in a microwave lab, Percy Spencer observed 
a chocolate bar melting by microwave power—thus, leading to the microwave 
oven. Clarence Birdseye was a fur trader in Canada when he noticed a phenom-
enon while ice fishing. At 50 degrees below zero, fish froze rock-hard almost 
instantly, yet when thawed, they were fresh and tender. After some experimen-
tation, he learned that the key was the speed at which foods were frozen. That 
observation led to the flash freezing process that created a multibillion-dollar 
industry and made Birdseye a success.
Would-be entrepreneurs need to be careful, however, not to mistake a new 
technology for a solution in itself. Ultimately, customers want a need filled or a 
Demand Pull at ResMed
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was a widespread but underdiagnosed 
problem during the 1980s and early 1990s. OSA occurs when tissue at 
the back of the throat collapses during sleep, blocking the airway and pre-
venting breathing. Oxygen levels drop in the bloodstream causing sharp 
fluctuations in heart rate and blood pressure. OSA is strongly correlated 
with other severe conditions—nearly half of all heart failure patients and 
60 percent of type 2 diabetes patients suffer from OSA. It was estimated 
that 2 percent of the U.S. population suffered from OSA in some form. It 
was clearly a massive problem waiting for a solution.
ResMed was founded in Australia to combat this problem. The com-
pany created a novel device that pressurized the airway during sleep to 
prevent the airway from blocking. The device was fantastically success-
ful and as recognition of OSA expanded during the early 1990s, ResMed 
took off. ResMed correctly identified a huge unsolved problem and pro-
vided a solution that fit into both the patient’s life and the health insur-
ers’ plans. As a result, the company has been incredibly successful. It 
is now public on the New York Stock Exchange with revenues of almost 
$1.4 billion in 2012.

CHAPTER 2   Opportunities28
TABLE 2.1 Nine categories of opportunity.
1.  Increasing the value of a product or service
2.  New applications of existing means or technologies

4.  Customization for individuals
5.  Increasing reach
6.  Managing the supply chain

problem solved. Usually, they do not care what technology is employed towards 
this goal. Thus, entrepreneurship is not about having a great technological idea, 
but rather about creating a new business that solves a problem.
Figure 2.1 summarizes and illustrates demand-pull and technology-push 
opportunities. In the demand-pull case, the entrepreneur begins with a market 
need. That need may be filled with several potential products, which may (or may 
not) have special technological capabilities. In the technology-push case, the entre-
preneur begins with a technological capability, which is often a new technology or 
a new application of an existing technology. This capability needs to be combined 
with other capabilities to make a cohesive product (and, often, the capability can 
be applied to multiple products). In turn, the selected product may be applied to 
various market and customer needs. In both cases, however, the ultimate task of 
the entrepreneur is to match an important need with a good solution.
Table 2.1 further dissects different opportunities into nine categories, which 
we use to describe additional ways of identifying opportunities. The first cat-
egory, and perhaps most common, is to increase the value of the product or ser-
vice. This increased value can include improved performance, better quality or

experience, and improved accessibility or other values unique to the product. For 
example, Shokay is a for-profit social enterprise based in Tibet that manufactur-
ers and distributes 100 percent yak down products including scarves and throws. 
The products are sourced from impoverished Tibetan yak herders with the 
broader mission of fostering economic development to remote areas of western 
China. Their products are luxurious, soft, and functional, and have wide appeal.
The second category seeks new applications of existing means or tech-
nologies. Credit cards with magnetic stripes were available in the 1960s, but a 
thoughtful innovator recognized the application of this technology to hotel door 
cards and created a wholly new application and industry.
The third category concentrates on creating mass markets for existing prod-
ucts. A good example is VMWare’s development. Initially, VMWare focused on 
a product that enabled software testers to check the quality of code using virtual 
environments. Thus, VMWare enabled a single machine to operate like multiple 
machines. VMWare recognized that with modest enhancements, the company 
could expand its product offering to run critical systems called operation work-
loads. The market for these operational application environments is at least an 
order of magnitude larger than that for quality assurance and test environments. 
As a result, VMWare expanded its product to a $10 billion market from an initial 
market of several hundred million dollars.
Customization of products for individuals, category 4, affords a new oppor-
tunity for an existing product or technology. Examples of customization can be 
found in the streaming music business. Spotify lets users play songs from their 
own libraries as well as from Spotify’s collection of millions of tracks. Users can 
access music via a desktop app, tablet, or smart phone. Spotify also integrates 
with social network sites, including Facebook.
Expanding geographic reach or online reach, category 5, allows a new ven-
ture to increase its number of customers. Founded in Scotland, Optos devel-
oped a novel eye exam technology and innovative pay-per-use business model. 
Backed by angel investors for many years, it carefully expanded its operations 
into the United States and Germany. It is now a viable public company listed on 
the London stock exchange.
Managing the supply chain, category 6, is a powerful force for improve-
ment. Wal-Mart integrated inventory-information systems in each store with its 
broader distribution system to reap economic benefits from improved inventory 
management.
Convergence of industries, category 7, affords new opportunities by cre-
ating novel combinations of markets and technologies. For example, genetic 
engineering is the convergence of electron microscopy, micromanipulation, and 
supercomputing.
Business and manufacturing process innovations, category 8, are another 
source of opportunity. For example, FedEx and other airborne shipping  systems 
changed the way in which individuals and organizations ship goods to one 
another.

Finally, the ninth category of opportunity is the increasing scale or 
 consolidation of industry. Historically, the railroad industry provides a  powerful 
example of consolidation in the United States. Consolidation of the railroads 
began by the turn of the twentieth century. Today, there are five major rail-
road companies, down from the thousands of companies in the late 1890s. More 
recent consolidation examples include the automobile manufacturing industry, 
cable and satellite TV broadcasters, and telecommunications carriers. Through 
mergers and acquisitions, an industry can be consolidated with attendant cost 
savings and value for the customer.
Any specific business opportunity may be portrayed in the three-dimensional 
cube of Figure 2.2. The entrepreneur identifies the customer, the required technology, 
and the application of this technology to create a solution. Different opportunities typ-
ically leverage different combinations of technologies, applications, and customers.
The entrepreneur’s personal background is key to the process of opportunity 
identification. In fact, since prior knowledge, experience and motivation play 
a major role in opportunity identification, different people may not recognize 
or perceive the same opportunity [Gregoire and Shepherd, 2012]. The people 
whom an entrepreneur knows, the activities she pursues, and even the books 
and magazines she reads can shape her awareness of opportunities [Ozgen and 
Baron, 2007].

2.2   Market Engagement and Design Thinking 31
Good opportunities can also vary from person-to-person since it is the 
entrepreneur who adds value to the opportunity by creating a response. The 
opportunity, and even a general response to it, is not unique—many people 
may recognize it. Few of them, however, will possess the relevant passion and 
capabilities to solve the problem. For example, many people propose to exploit 
the new science of nanotechnology to solve various problems, but few of them 
will act. The true entrepreneur finds the best opportunity that matches his or her 
interests, skills, and knowledge—and acts to get it done. Thus, it is really the 
passion and capabilities that distinguish an entrepreneurial team.
Frank Slootman is a good example of an entrepreneur who found an  opportunity 
that matched his interests, capabilities and passion. Slootman joined Data Domain, 
a company with 20 employees, no customers, and no revenue. He felt he could 
make a meaningful difference to an organization that was pursuing a large mar-
ket if successful, under his guidance, it could become a highly valuable company. 
 Slootman said that the problem Data Domain was  solving – enabling disk econo-
mies for backup/recovery storage “spoke to him.” He also felt going in that he 
could provide leadership to a group of very talented  technical engineers. During the 
next six years he led the company to become the undisputed leader in its field, tak-
ing it public and through an eventual acquisition by EMC for $2.4 billion in 2009.
2.2 Market Engagement and Design Thinking
Entrepreneurs must engage with the market on a continual basis in order to iden-
tify and validate opportunities. Market research is the process of gathering infor-
mation that can be used to refine an opportunity and to plot and execute upon a 
strategy. This information is critical to the new venture team; without it, a new 
venture may launch a product only to find out that the customer does not value it. 
Customer development is the process of the discovery, validation, and cre-
ation of customers leading to company building, as shown in Figure 2.3 [Blank, 
2012]. In the first step, the entrepreneur works to identify the customers, to 
determine whether the problem that the entrepreneur is solving is important to 
them, and to assess whether they value the proposed solution. In the second step,

CHAPTER 2   Opportunities32
the entrepreneur builds a repeatable sales roadmap based upon actual customer 
commitments. Iteration – the reconsideration and adjustment of the problem, 
product, and customer hypotheses – is especially common in these first two steps 
as the entrepreneur works to refine an idea. In the third step, customer creation, 
the entrepreneur works to build upon initial sales by creating end-user demand. 
Finally, the startup transitions from an informal learning and discovery organi-
zation into one with formal sales, marketing and business-development depart-
ments that build on the startup’s success [Blank, 2013].
Primary data – that is, data collected for your specific proposed venture – are 
particularly important to the customer development process; there is no substi-
tute for engaging with actual customers. One popular form of primary research 
uses the focus group, which is a small group of people from the target market. 
These people are brought together in a room to have a discussion about the prob-
lem or proposed product. This discussion can be led by someone from the ven-
ture team or by a professional moderator who may elicit more honest feedback 
due to her detachment from the venture. Table 2.2 outlines the general process 
for convening and running a focus group. The overall goal is to obtain honest 
feedback from a group that is representative of your intended market.
Entrepreneurs can also collect data from surveys and from customer interviews. 
One advantage of interviews over focus groups is that individual interviewees can 
avoid “groupthink” that leads participants to converge towards the same responses. 
Typically, an entrepreneur also can entice individuals to a one-on-one interview 
who may not participate in a broad focus group.
Table 2.3 offers several tips for conducting customer interviews. As with focus 
groups, effective interviews employ open-ended questions and encourage honest 
feedback. It is important for entrepreneurs to use customer engagement to elicit 
new insights and to challenge preconceptions – not simply to seek information that 
confirms current assumptions [Sanchez Garcia et al., 2011].
When using customer interviews or focus groups to obtain feedback on a pro-
posed solution, it also can be effective to use the “a day in your life” format. This 
format takes customers through their day before and after the new product launch 
to expose the expected benefits of the new product. Another widely used approach 
TABLE 2.2 Steps to conduct a focus group.
1. Determine the purpose and goal of the focus group
2. Identify and attract the appropriate people to participate, based on the purpose, goal, and 
target market

tral to the purpose and goal of the meeting
4. Use simple, open-ended questions

is to ask customers to compare two alternatives and to reflect on what they value 
about each of them. These comparisons can be quantified through conjoint analysis, 
where the researcher asks a respondent to make trade-off adjustments and deci-
sions. Conjoint analysis provides a quantitative measure of the relative importance 
of one attribute as opposed to another. Although this method requires an investment 
of time and money in the research process, it may be worth it to avoid misreading 
customers’ preferences [Aaker et al., 2001].
Focus groups, surveys, and customer interviews all face a challenge in that they 
have a limited ability to identify new problems and solutions. As Henry Ford, the 
automotive pioneer, once remarked, “If I’d asked my customers what they wanted, 
they’d have said a faster horse.” Similarly, no potential customer ever asked for 
ATMs, personal computers, the Internet, or highly portable music players. Akio 
Marita, the founder of Sony, seized on this last opportunity. Marita directed his 
engineers to design a small portable radio and cassette player that would provide 
good audio quality and be attached to a person’s head. Although no customer was 
asking for this product, the Sony Walkman became one of the twentieth century’s 
most successful applications of miniaturized electronics and it fueled a market later 
addressed by the Apple iPod and other innovations.
Since customers cannot always verbalize their problems and needs, direct 
observations are another important means of gathering customer information. 
As human factors expert Leon Segal says, “Innovation begins with an eye” 
[ Kelley, 2001]. By studying potential customers engaged in their everyday activ-
ities, entrepreneurs can see first-hand the behaviors, frustrations, bottlenecks 
and other cues that may indicate a need or problem – and, therefore, a poten-
tial opportunity. For example, the healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente had 
a project team conduct observations at four hospitals in order to improve both 
patient and medical-practitioner experiences. The project team quickly focused 
on nursing-staff shift changes. They found that nurses spent a great deal of time

trying to convey information to the new shift and that much of the most impor-
tant information was still missed or miscommunicated since there was no easy or 
standardized means of sharing. These observation-based insights enabled Kaiser 
Permanente to introduce a new system that improved patient care and nurses’ job 
satisfaction [Brown, 2008].
There are several ways that entrepreneurs can act as effective observers. First, 
rather than rely on expertise to guide observations, entrepreneurs may find that 
naivety is a gift. For example, Jane Goodall attributes her groundbreaking research 
on chimpanzees to the fact that she had little prior knowledge about chimpanzee 
behavior. She, therefore, was not blinded to novel findings by any preconceptions 
[Sutton, 2002]. Second, when selecting people to observe, it can be particularly 
effective to study “extreme” users – such as children – and “rule breakers” who 
face novel constraints or who apply products in new ways. Finally, observations 
are most effective when the observers themselves come from multiple backgrounds 
and perspectives. Diversity enables a team of entrepreneurs to imagine the world 
from multiple perspectives in order to identify meaningful problems and novel 
solutions [Kelley, 2001].
The customer development process and the product development process 
proceed in parallel. Thus, as entrepreneurs gather data from the market, they 
should also work to create and refine product mockups and prototypes. Eric Ries 
and Steve Blank are the leading supporters of the idea of a “lean startup.” Ries 
coined the term “lean startup,” and Blank created a course called “The Lean 
Launchpad” that teaches entrepreneurs many of the concepts initially discussed 
by Ries [Ries, 2011]. When building lean startups, entrepreneurs focus on learn-
ing what customers may be interested in, and proceed to build a “minimum via-
ble product” in order to see if there is demand for their initial product offering. 
Thus, rather than waiting until the product is “perfect,” entrepreneurs are advised 
to start selling early [Onyemah, 2013]. Additional product features can then be 
added over time. Startups that utilize the lean approach are typically funded with 
smaller amounts of initial capital and seek incremental capital once the founders 
gain confidence that there is a market and have proven that they can build viable 
products. These startups also make heavy use of crowdsourcing, outsourcing, 
cloud computing, and Software as a Service (SaaS) in order to limit their cash 
outlays [McQuivey, 2013].
Sahl Khan followed this approach when launching the Khan Academy, a 
virtual school providing software and video tutorials in math, science and other 
subjects. Kahn created almost all of the company’s initial videos himself, often 
creating a video in just one or two days. His approach was to get videos out on the 
web quickly to see if they gained traction, thus testing the market and gathering 
feedback. Khan also runs his service on outsourced hardware. By following the 
lean approach, Khan proved his business model on very limited initial capital. By 
2013, Khan Academy had over five million unique visitors each month and over 
one million page views per day. The company is well on its way to revolutionizing 
the way education is taught and consumed.

2.3   Types and Sources of Innovation 35
2.3 Types and Sources of Innovation
Opportunities often reside at the nexus of a market need and a technological 
capability. Thus, entrepreneurs should simultaneously engage with the market 
and with the process of technological innovation. Innovation is based on team-
work and creativity, and is defined as invention that has produced economic 
value in the marketplace. Innovations can be new products, new processes, new 
services, and new ways of doing business.
There are several different types of innovation, as illustrated in Figure 2.4. 
Incremental innovation is characterized by faster, better, and/or cheaper ver-
sions of existing products. Thus, entrepreneurs engaged in incremental inno-
vation take an existing idea and creatively expand on it. To be successful, the 
incremental innovator must understand specific customer needs that are unmet 
by current offerings. For example, portable, battery-driven radios have been 
used since the 1950s. But, Trevor Bayles saw an opportunity to bring informa-
tion to remote Africa by creating a wind-up spring- and dynamo-powered radio. 
Twenty-five seconds of winding gives the user one hour of listening. Bay Gen in 
Cape Town, South Africa, now manufactures more than 60,000 of these radios a 
month [Handy, 1999].
Like incremental innovation, architectural innovation leaves core design 
concepts untouched. But, architectural innovation changes the way in which 
components of a product are linked together. Thus, the components remain 
unchanged, but the architecture of module connection is the innovation. (The 
overall architecture of the product describes how the components will work 
together.) The essence of an architectural innovation is the reconfiguration 
of an established system to link together existing components in a new way 
[ Henderson and Clark, 1990]. By contrast, modular innovation is focused on 
the innovation of new components and modules. But, it does not disrupt the link-
ages between modules.

CHAPTER 2   Opportunities36
Finally, radical innovation or disruptive innovation uses new modules 
and new architecture to create new products. The Internet is an example of a 
network system with new modules and new architecture – a radical or disruptive 
innovation. Disruptive innovation transforms the relationship between customer 
and supplier, restructures markets, displaces current products, and often creates 
new product categories [Leifer et al., 2000]. Disruptive products also introduce a 
new value proposition [Christensen et al., 2004]. For example, e-mail is an appli-
cation on the Internet that is a disruptive application (often called a “killer app”) 
and is one reason that the Internet so widely used.
Salesforce.com introduced a disruptive application for sales force activity 
tracking. Salesforce.com started selling sales force automation on a Software 
as a Service (SaaS) basis, in which customers pay a monthly licensing fee. This 
arrangement contrasts dramatically with the way that the incumbent leaders 
in sales force automation, Oracle and SAP, were selling software: Oracle and 
SAP would charge a one-time license fee that could run into hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars, and would additionally charge yearly maintenance fees. Fur-
thermore, they made customers responsible for running and updating their own 
software. By contrast, Salesforce.com would run and maintain the customer’s 
software. New customers implementing sales force automation were much more 
likely to try to implement their solution with lower up-front costs.
An emerging disruptive innovation is three-dimensional (3D) printing. 
3D printers enable the making of parts and products using a computer-driven, 
additive process, one layer at a time. 3D printing builds plastic and metal parts 
directly from CAD drawings that have been cross-sectioned into thousands of 
layers. It provides a faster and less costly alternative to machining (cutting, turn-
ing, grinding and drilling solid materials). Used for making prototypes as well 
as final products, 3D printing evolved from the “rapid prototyping” industry, 
pioneered by Chuck Hull of 3D Systems in the mid-1980s. Time will tell the 
extent of 3D printing’s impact, but, for now, dozens to hundreds of startups and 
many bigger companies are betting their time and money that it will be the next 
big thing [Economist, 2012a].
Other good examples of disruptive innovations include the invention of the 
“800” number toll-free telephone call by AT&T and the development of the CT 
scanner for medical imaging, which combined X-ray technology with computer 
technology [Adner and Levinthal, 2002]. These types of disruptive applications 
bring significant value to a product and cause an industry to grow exponentially. 
They also are associated with improved odds of success for an entrepreneur. 
New firms that attempt to make an incrementally-better product and sell it to the 
same customers as existing firms experience only a 6-percent success rate; new 
firms that introduce disruptive innovations experience a 33-percent success rate 
[Christensen, 2002].
Sources of innovation include existing companies, research laboratories 
and universities, independent inventors and “user innovators,” and open techni-
cal communities. Many companies are formed when employees in an existing 
enterprise have ideas for a new product and they decide that the best way to 
bye23429_ch02_025-050.indd   36bye23429_ch02_025-050.indd   36 12/2/13   11:45 AM12/2/13   11:45 AM

2.3   Types and Sources of Innovation 37
pursue it is as an independent venture. Of course, employees need to be care-
ful about legal restrictions, which may restrain competition or require a license. 
Often, however, employees can take existing market insights and even technical 
knowledge and apply it to a new venture.
Universities are another important source of innovation. Professors, gradu-
ate students and other university researchers conduct an enormous amount of 
cutting-edge research. Since academic research typically is not driven by direct 
market needs, however, a major challenge in the commercialization of univer-
sity breakthroughs lies in the need to move this research from lab prototypes 
and concepts into complete working products that can be manufactured reli-
ably at a reasonable cost [Jensen and Thursby, 2001]. To get the most benefit 
from a relationship with a university, a new venture should take a long-term 
view and imagine a partnership focused on both technical and strategic issues. 
When companies take a transactional approach to the relationship, attempting 
to pick technologies, sign a contract, and quickly commercialize them, they are 
likely to fail [Wright, 2008]. By contrast, when an inventor stays involved with 
product development as it moves from the university to a start-up, the chances 
of success increase dramatically [Thursby and Thursby, 2004]. University-
sourced innovations also present special legal challenges, which we will discuss 
in Chapter 11.
Many innovations come from end-users themselves [von Hippel, 2006]. 
For example, snowboarding, skateboarding, and windsurfing trace their ori-
gins to users who experimented with new combinations of equipment [Shah, 
2003]. Similarly, end-users have developed innovations ranging from library 
information systems to baby strollers to chemical processing techniques 
[Shah and  Tripsas, 2007]. Because users may understand their own needs and 
the limitations of existing products, they are uniquely positioned to innovate. 
Entrepreneurs are wise to engage with user-innovators to understand emerging 
technologies [ Chatterji and Fabrizio, 2012].
Many user-innovators also participate in open technical communities 
[B aldwin and von Hippel, 2011]. These communities may be autonomous or 
sponsored and their members may include both individuals and organizations. 
Open technical communities play a crucial role in helping new enterprises to 
develop and deploy innovations [West and O’Mahony, 2008]. Firms benefit 
from participating in open communities by gathering information on potential 
alliances, identifying new opportunities, and sharing work and risk. Further-
more, such communities offer the benefit of transparency of developments and 
ready accessibility to shared knowledge.
An open source innovation community may be defined as a collection 
of many firms and individuals collaborating to develop and deploy an innova-
tion. These communities share a common goal and an agreed-to governance 
system. Open source software communities are important examples of open 
technical communities. Individual members of these communities share com-
mon goals, but not a common employer. Examples are the Mozilla and Hadoop 
communities.

CHAPTER 2   Opportunities38
Effective open source organizations enable new ventures to build on the 
ideas of others to create new innovations [Murray and O’Mahony, 2008]. 
 Cumulative innovation is enabled by ready access, disclosure, and incentives 
associated with community activities. The sharing process enables knowledge 
to be reused, recombined, and accumulated, often in a modular format that all 
members can readily access and use.
One example of a good open source effort is the Collaborative Software Ini-
tiative (CSI), based in Portland, Oregon. Their enterprise software solutions are 
based on the efforts of contributors worldwide and are potentially more effective 
than individual or independent development. Other examples include  Wikipedia, 
a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit, and YouTube, which contains 
an ever-expanding video library based upon the contributions of users [Tapscott 
and Williams, 2008].
Both market needs and technology developments tend to align with broader 
trends. Moreover, the convergence of different markets and technologies can 
point to new opportunities. For example, just 30 years ago both online shopping 
and the use of mobile phones to maintain social networks were far-off dreams. 
Today, hundreds of millions of people shop online and mobile phones are wide-
spread on every continent. 
One of the most important trends lies in the globalization of business. Spe-
cifically, the Internet and overnight shipping have negated time and distance. 
This trend enables entrepreneurs to reach vastly larger markets and to build busi-
nesses that bring together a far more diverse set of resources. At the same time, 
of course, entrepreneurs face new competitors around the globe.
Growing environmental consciousness and associated challenges with cli-
mate change and pollution are other trends that shape the opportunity landscape. 
Consumers increasingly demand products that minimize negative environmental 
impacts. In turn, the redesign of products for sustainability presents enormous 
opportunities [Russo, 2010].
Social and cultural trends offer many examples of opportunity. Table 2.4 
lists several social and cultural trends. One of the biggest current trends in 
America is the aging of the baby-boom generation—those born between 1946 
and 1973. During those years, 107.5 million Americans were born, making up

2.4   Trends and Convergence 39
50 percent of everyone alive in 1973 [Hoover, 2001]. Those born in the peak-
birth year of 1961 will be 55 in 2016 and acting as consumers of goods and ser-
vices such as new homes, travel, healthcare and retirement plans. Other critical 
trends include the changing role of women in many societies and broadening 
access to education, including online education.
Entrepreneurs can sometimes study a trend to see how it might apply in other 
settings. Peer-to-peer services are one example. Airbnb is best known for enabling 
one person to work with another person to rent a room rather than staying in a 
more expensive hotel. That same model can be applied to many other services, such 
as car rentals and money transfers [de Boer, 2012]. For example, Lending Club 
and Prosper are establishing person-to-person lending, eliminating the bank as a 
middleman [Landes, 2012].
Opportunities often lie at the intersection of social and technological change. 
For example, new online education businesses are positioned at the intersection of 
growing interest in education and lifelong learning, on one hand, and increasing 
penetration of high-speed Internet and mobile Internet devices on the other hand. 
As another example, new business are forming at the intersection of Unmanned 
Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and regulatory changes that are permitting these UAVs to 
access U.S. airspace.
One of the most promising areas of science and engineering is based on several 
breakthroughs that enable the manipulation of matter at the molecular level. Mass 
production of products with these molecular adjustments now offers a world of 
possibilities. Nanotechnology will make materials lighter, more durable, and more 
stain resistant, and will enable the creation of products with wholly new capabili-
ties. (One nanometer is one-billionth of a meter.) 
With the need for security and safety of personal information, the emergence 
of personal identification cards, or smart cards, may be the next trend in America. 
A smart card is a plastic card incorporating an integrated circuit chip and memory 
that stores and transfers data such as personal data and identification information 
for example, finger or palm print or facial scans. These cards have been adopted 
in several European and Asian countries and could spread worldwide. One form 
of smart card, the Octopus Card, is used in Hong Kong to pay for everything from 
subway rides to groceries. Another important use of smart cards would be a com-
mon approach for driver’s licenses and personal information. Table 2.5 lists several 
other technology-related trends and opportunities.
Opportunities also emerge as the boundaries between many once-distinct 
businesses, from agribusiness and chemicals to energy and computing, continue 
to blur. The convergence of technologies or industries is the coming together or 
merging of several technologies or industries thought to be different or separate. 
Often, opportunities can be found in creative combinations that build on comple-
mentary technologies. 
One example of industry convergence is that of computing and communica-
tions, which merged into the field of networks. Another example is convergence 
of a handheld computer and a mobile phone, now evident in Apple’s iPhone and 
Samsung’s Galaxy.

CHAPTER 2   Opportunities40
Satellite imaging and data and the handheld computer converged into global 
positioning system (GPS) devices, which are widely used, inexpensive devices that 
address the need for accurate locational data. Scanners, computers, and security 
systems converged into self-checkout systems for shoppers. Gene chips use semi-
conductor technology to speed up biochemistry lab analysis. Finally, medical and 
robotic technologies have converged to facilitate highly-precise minimally-invasive 
robotic surgery. Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci medical robot has four arms and flex-
ible wrists mounted with tools and cameras that can be controlled by a surgeon. 
The robots are being used for prostate surgeries, hysterectomies, and even more 
complicated surgeries like heart valve repair. As these examples highlight, effec-
tive entrepreneurs carefully examine social and technological trends. They strive to 
identify novel combinations that may point to significant opportunities.

2.5 Opportunity Evaluation
Alongside the identification of opportunities, entrepreneurs should work to 
evaluate these opportunities. In fact, a critical task of the entrepreneur is to dis-
tinguish between an idea and a true opportunity. Good opportunities have the 
potential to solve important and timely problems. As shown in Table 2.6, attrac-
tive opportunities also have the potential to be profitable and can be pursued 
under a favorable regulatory and industry context. 
Choosing the right opportunity is both difficult and important. This choice 
is analogous to the selection of an equity investment in a company: Entrepre-
neurs will invest time, effort, and money in the venture they choose in a manner 
similar to how people invest in the stock of a company. Some sound investment 
principles that can be used for selecting opportunities are listed in Table 2.7.

2.5   Opportunity Evaluation 41
The entrepreneur finds and thoroughly analyzes the best opportunities, since 
for many people, only one or two opportunities are needed to make a good life 
of entrepreneurial activity. One goal is to invest in a firm for which you pay less 
than it is worth; this provides some cushion for unforeseen challenges. Also, 
entrepreneurs try to find an opportunity with solid long-term potential in an 
industry they understand. They put together a good management team that can 
execute the strategy for this opportunity. And, they ensure that the customer 
will allow their firm to profit from the venture. Thus, they avoid industries that 
sell commodities where price is the only differentiation unless they have a new, 
innovative business process that enables their firm to be the low-cost provider.
Tom Stemberg, the founder of Staples, conceived the idea of a supermar-
ket store for office supplies in the mid-1980s. He didn’t like the politics of big 
companies and sought independence. He started with a single store in Brighton, 
Massachusetts, and built 1,500 outlets. He carried out a complete analysis of the 
opportunity and determined it was a $100 billion market growing at 15 percent 
per year with large profit margins.
The review of opportunities will always include the evaluation of alterna-
tives. The opportunity cost of an action is the value (cost) of the forgone alter-
native action. Selecting one opportunity will involve rejecting others. Chapter 1 
discussed some of the considerations that people should use when deciding 
whether to become an entrepreneur by pursuing a specific opportunity. A critical 
part of this decision hinges on the quality of the opportunity in terms of a mar-
ket assessment, feasibility of implementation, and differentiation of the product. 
TABLE 2.6 Five characteristics of an attractive opportunity.
 ■ Timely—a current need or problem
 ■ Solvable—a problem that can be solved in 
the near future with accessible resource
 ■ Important—the customer deems the 
problem or need important
 ■ Profitable—the customer will pay for 
the solution and allow the enterprise to 
profit
 ■ Context—a favorable regulatory and 
industry situation
TABLE 2.7 Guiding principles for selecting good opportunities.
 ■ Only one or two very good opportunities 
are needed in a lifetime.
 ■ Invest less time, money, and effort in the 
venture than it will be worth in one or 
two years. Calculate the probability of a 
large return in four years.
 ■ Do not count on making a high-priced 
sale of your firm to the public or another 
company.
 ■ Carry out a solid analysis of the current 
and expected conditions of the industry 
where the opportunity resides.
 ■ If the opportunity is selected and turns 
out unfavorably, can you exit with minor 
losses?
 ■ Does this opportunity provide a poten-
tial for a long-term success, or is it a 
fad? Go to where the potential future 
gains are significant.
 ■ Can the management team execute the 
strategy selected for this opportunity?
 ■ Will the customer enable your firm to 
profit from this venture?

CHAPTER 2   Opportunities42
There is an inherent tension in entrepreneurship in that much of this analysis 
requires additional information, yet a comprehensive analytical approach to 
evaluation of the opportunity does not suit most start-ups; entrepreneurs often 
lack the time and money to fully engage with all potential customers, analyze 
substitutes, reconstruct competitors’ cost structures, and project alternative plan-
ning scenarios.
Most entrepreneurial teams instead follow a basic five-step process, as 
outlined in Table 2.8. The goal is to assess these five characteristics – capa-
bilities, novelty, resources, return, and commitment – to quickly weed out 
unpromising ventures and thus conserve energy and time for the promising 
ones. The appropriate analytical effort and the issues that are most worthy 
of research and analysis depend on the characteristics of each venture. For 
example, the exploration process should be short for potential ventures with 
low degrees of novelty [Choi et al., 2008]. In general, however, an entrepre-
neur works through the five steps and eliminates the opportunities that do not 
pass muster. Those that do pass a quick review are worth looking into further.
The iPod Opportunity
In the late 1990s, many people had been listening to music stored on their 
computers that was obtained through the Napster file-sharing service. 
The challenge was to design and sell a portable music storage and player 
device. Tony Fadell, who had worked at General Magic, started his own 
company, Fuse, to design consumer electronic products. He tried to secure 
financing for the design of a portable music player. Without financing, he 
went to Apple in February 2001 as a contractor and then in April 2002 
joined Apple as an employee to lead the iPod project. Fadell and Apple 
together recognized that the iPod opportunity possessed all the character-
istics of Table 2.7. The capabilities, resources, and commitment of Apple 
and Fadell enabled them to build a device, the iPod, that was truly novel 
and that could offer a significant return.
TABLE 2.8 Basic five-step process of evaluating an opportunity.
1. Capabilities: Is the venture opportunity consistent with the capabilities, knowledge, and 
experience of the team members?
2. Novelty: Does the product or service have significant novel, proprietary, or differentiat-
ing qualities? Does it create significant value for the customer—enough so that the cus-
tomer wants the product and will pay a premium for it?
3. Resources: Can the venture team attract the necessary financial, physical, and human 
resources consistent with the magnitude of the venture?
4. Return: Can the product be produced at a cost so that a profit can be obtained? Is the 
expected return of the venture consistent with the risk of the venture?
5. Commitment: Do the entrepreneurial team members feel compelled to commit to this 
venture? Are they passionate about the venture?

2.5   Opportunity Evaluation 43
A Big Opportunity in Television
What is the next big opportunity in television? Flat-panel television has 
been one of the compelling trends in consumer technology. A switch from 
the bulky cathode-ray tube to flat panel displays is under way in the multi 
billion unit global market. Opportunities exist in the market for glass and 
the devices and chips for digital light processing. Another opportunity is 
making the sets and selling them. As nations switch to high-definition TV 
(HDTV), the market for flat panel displays has grown significantly. Which 
of these opportunities pass the evaluation process of Table 2.8?
The entrepreneur has to live with critical uncertainties, such as the relative 
competence of rivals or the preferences of customers, which are not easy to ana-
lyze. Who could have forecast, for example, that IBM would turn to Microsoft 
for an operating system for its personal computer, allow Microsoft to retain the 
rights to this operating system, and thus enable Microsoft to gain monopolistic 
dominance of the operating system marketplace? Entering a race requires faith 
in one’s ability to finish ahead of whoever else might participate.
When evaluating an opportunity, the entrepreneur considers whether it fits or 
matches the contextual conditions, the team’s capabilities and characteristics, and 
the team’s ability to secure the necessary resources to initiate a new venture based 
on the opportunity. Figure 2.5 shows a diagram of fit or congruence that can be 
used to review an opportunity. A big diamond with high grades of fit are best.
Consider an opportunity that has existed for over 100 years—the electric 
automobile. We will assume that a capable set of engineers is available and the 
entrepreneurial team has the attitudes and capabilities required. However, the 
team is insecure about the risky nature of the venture, given the numerous failures 
over the past century. We will rate the entrepreneurial team at 75 percent on the 
team scale. The characteristics of the context are very mixed since regulations and 
support for electric cars are continually changing as potential customers and 
government organizations adjust their assessment of the benefits and costs of 
these vehicles. We will rate this opportunity as only 50 percent on the context 
scale. Next we turn to the opportunity, which is challenged by costs, limited life 
batteries, and short ranges before a recharge is required. The characteristics of 
the opportunity call for a rating of 75 percent on the opportunity scale. Given 
these ratings, most teams would be severely limited in their ability to secure the 
tens of millions of dollars required to launch this venture. Thus, we rate it only 
50 percent on the resource scale. Clearly, this opportunity is a challenging one. 
At the same time, however, Tesla and other electric car companies have demon-
strated that the right team backed by significant resources can make the electric 
automobile opportunity much more attractive.
Another way of envisioning the concept of a fit with an opportunity is shown 
graphically in Figure 2.6. Both markets and industries must be examined on the 
macrolevel and the microlevel. Moreover, the team must be evaluated across

multiple dimensions. An ideal opportunity lies where the market and industry are 
attractive, customer benefits are compelling, the start-up’s advantage is sustain-
able, and the team can deliver the results it seeks [Mullins, 2006]. 
After evaluating an opportunity by using the factors in Table 2.8, the entre-
preneurs should decide whether to act. With the knowledge generated by using 
the five-step process in Table 2.8, the entrepreneurs will tend to act on their esti-
mate of the potential benefits and gains, B, while accounting for the total costs of 
the venture, C. Within the total cost accounting, there will need to be a recogni-
tion of their security needs and loss aversion. An individual will tend to act if the

ratio B/C is greater than 1. The lucrative opportunity (high benefits and low losses) 
will tend to cause higher intention to act [McMullen and Shepherd, 2002]. If one 
acts and it is a false choice, the cost of that choice is important. Opportunities that 
can be attempted with low initial financial and time commitment costs may offer 
the chance for lucrative returns at a low initial cost.
The matrix in Figure 2.7 shows the decision to act or not act. Then, the 
actual resulting quality of the opportunity is shown (this can be determined only 
after the decision). Life is about choices, and the best case is when we choose to 
act and it turns out we are right!

Fix and

FIGURE 2.8 Act-learn-fix cycle 
of building a new venture.
The entrepreneur attempts to make a rational decision based on (1) his or 
her current psychological and financial assets, and (2) the possible consequences 
of the choice [Hastie and Dawes, 2001]. The decision challenge is the task of 
turning incomplete knowledge of an opportunity into an action consistent with 
that knowledge. Competitive advantage comes from actually doing something 
that others cannot do; analyses and reports cannot substitute for action, and 
 reworking a plan is no substitute for acting to get things done. In the end, an 
opportunity can be evaluated only so much [Pfeffer and Sutton, 2000]. Ambigu-
ity remains, and the entrepreneur needs to act on or reject the opportunity. Fear 
of failure may overwhelm all but the best opportunities.
Ultimately, identifying a good opportunity is less about making an initial 
selection and more about gathering data and refining the idea accordingly. 
Thus, while it is important to estimate fit, as in Figure 2.5, it is critical to 
act on the opportunity, trying it out in the marketplace of ideas and inves-
tors. Data gathered and lessons learned from these initial attempts can lead to 
refinement of the opportunity. Tom Peters and Robert Waterman [1982] called 
this approach “ready, fire, aim.” Banishing fear of failure and learning from 
a series of small failures can lead to a good new venture. The act-review-fix 
cycle, as shown in Figure 2.8, summarizes the critical ability to act, review, 
and learn from the results, and then, fix and adjust the business scheme as 
required. As John Stuart Mill stated: “There are many truths of which the full 
meaning cannot be realized until personal experience has brought it home.”
2.6 Spotlight on Solazyme

2.7   Summary 47
San Francisco firm’s initial focus was the manufacture of transportation oil. By 
2010, Solazyme expanded to making oil-based nutrition and cosmetics products 
as well.
Solazyme combines features of technology-push and demand-pull opportu-
nities. The company has taken advantage of the convergence of new production 
technologies, extreme fluctuations in the supply and price of crude oil, and trends 
in energy and the environment. They emphasize a customer-driven approach to 
technology and product development. In May 2011, Solazyme made an initial 
public offering that raised $198 million. Solazyme is leveraging a strong team 
and a novel product, in a favorable context with significant resources. Thus, the 
opportunity appears promising.
Principle 2
The capable entrepreneur knows how to identify, select, describe, 
and communicate an opportunity that has good potential to become a 
successful venture.
2.7 Summary
The entrepreneur identifies numerous problems and needs that may point to good 
opportunities that can be made into great companies. However, he or she searches 
for the one that best fits the capabilities of the team, the characteristics of the 
business context, the characteristics of the opportunity, and the team’s capability 
to secure the necessary resources. Then, the entrepreneur decides whether to act 
or not act on that best-fit opportunity.
The important ideas of the chapter are:
 ■ Great opportunities are often disguised as problems that are difficult to 
describe.
 ■ Opportunities can be tied to market demands and new technological 
capabilities.
 ■ New technologies can arise from existing companies, universities, users, 
and open source communities.
 ■ Social and technological trends shape opportunities.
 ■ Entrepreneurs must engage with the market on a continual basis in order to 
identify and validate opportunities.
 ■ Attractive opportunities are timely, solvable, important, profitable, and 
they exist in a favorable context.
 ■ The entrepreneurial team should cumulatively possess all the necessary 
capabilities.
 ■ Entrepreneurs should, if possible, act on favorable opportunities in a timely 
manner.

 3.7 Summary
How do successful entrepreneurs create a com-
pelling business design for their new ventures?
A 
new business should develop a clear vision 
or long-term destiny and a mission state-
ment that captures its goals. Any new busi-
ness is defined by the wants or needs that customers 
satisfy when they buy a product or service. To cre-
ate a theory of a new business, the entrepreneur 
must cogently and clearly describe the customers 
and their needs and how the new venture will satisfy 
those needs. A business model describes the rela-
tionship between a venture’s customers, value prop-
osition, differentiation, scope, organization design, 
and profit model.  Figure  3.1 outlines the steps 
towards the creation of a  business model.

FIGURE 3.1 
Creating a business 
model for a new 
venture.
Once the entrepreneur identifies a good opportunity and decides to pursue it, the 
next step is to formulate a vision. A vision is an informed and forward- looking 
statement of purpose that defines the long-term destiny of the firm. Thus, if 
the entrepreneur recognizes a good opportunity to meet a real customer need, 
he or she describes a vision of a future venture that will respond effectively 
to that opportunity. The vision is a statement of insight, intention, ambition, 
and  purpose. It reflects clearly the novelty of the solution and uniqueness of 
the entrepreneur’s commitment. Successful entrepreneurs are able to communi-
cate their vision and their enthusiasm about that vision to others. For example, 
Google’s vision, conveyed by founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, is: online 
search that reliably provides fast and relevant results.
A good vision is clear, consistent, unique, and purposeful, as summarized in 
Table 3.1 [Hoover, 2001]. Clarity means that the vision is easily understood and 
focused. Consistency means that the vision does not change in response to daily 
challenges and fads. Uniqueness means that the vision is tailored to the specific 
venture. Finally, the purpose of the firm defines the enduring character of the 
organization, consistently held to and understood through the life of the firm. 
The purpose, or core ideology, of Hewlett-Packard has been a respect for the 
individual, a dedication to innovation, and a commitment to service to society. 
The purpose of Merck is to gain victory against disease and help mankind. This 
core ideology provides the glue that holds an organization together [Collins and 
Porras, 1996]. The vision provides a clear picture of the future for all concerned. 
The core ideology is based on the core values of the organization, such as respect 
for the individual.
A vision describes a specific desired outcome and promotes action and 
change. It serves as a picture of the organization’s destiny as it moves through 
challenge and change. It also provides the basis for a strategy. A vision is an 
imaginable picture of the future. It is like a rudder on a boat in a turbulent sea. 
An example of a simple, clear vision is given in Table 3.2. This vision state-
ment provides the reader with a clear mental model of where the firm is going 
and how it will get there. Notice that the vision statement of Table 3.2 states the 
 values and goals of the firm, and it inspires and motivates people. 
Entrepreneurs need to create a shared vision or meaning for their venture. A 
dialogue of meaning and commitment will help bring a shared sense of urgency 
TABLE 3.1 Elements of a vision.
 ■ Clarity: Easily understood and focused
 ■ Consistency: Holds constant over a time period, but is adjustable as conditions warrant
 ■ Uniqueness: Special to this enterprise

3.1   The Vision 53
and importance for the venture. Thus, the vision is used as a part of the business 
plan and described often to potential team members and investors. 
The vision can be verbally expressed as a story. A story is a narrative ver-
sion of the vision, told in an engaging way. Stories play an important role in the 
processes that enable new businesses to emerge. Stories help to make the unfa-
miliar new enterprise more familiar, understandable, acceptable, and thus more 
legitimate to key constituencies [Lounsbury and Glynn, 2001]. By clarifying the 
core idea behind an enterprise, a story can also help an enterprise raise money 
and gather other resources [Martens et al., 2007].
Jim Clark started three companies: Silicon Graphics, Netscape, and 
 Healtheon (now WebMD). As recounted in The New New Thing [Lewis, 2000], 
TABLE 3.2 Example of a vision for an innovative firm.

CHAPTER 3   Vision and the Business Model54
Clark stated, “The only thing I can do is start ‘em.” As Lewis [2000] described 
Clark’s realization:
His role in the Valley was suddenly clear: he was the author of the story. He 
was the man with the nerve to invent the tale in which all the characters—
the engineers, the VCs, the managers, the bankers—agreed to play the role 
he assigned them. And if he was going to retain the privilege of telling the 
stories, he had to make sure the stories had happy endings.
Clark had a vision for eliminating waste in the $300 billion costs of the 
U.S. health system by using the Internet to enable all the parties of any health 
transaction to connect via an online network—no paper forms, no hassle. Clark 
sketched a diamond depicting the players, as shown in Figure 3.2, and placed his 
proposed company, Healtheon, in the middle as intermediary. This was the way 
Clark told his ambitious stories—graphically, using sketches. Tales told by the 
entrepreneur aim to show plausibility and build confidence that the enterprise 
can succeed. To construct an identity that legitimates a new venture, entrepre-
neurial stories must have narrative clarity and resonate with the expectations, 
interests, and agendas of potential stakeholders [Lounsbury and Glynn, 2001].
Entrepreneurs need to learn how to tell their story about their team and ven-
ture, and to explain how their products will solve a problem. Their vision of the 
future can capture the interest of investors and team members.
TABLE 3.3 Possible elements of a mission statement.
 ■ Core values
 ■ Customers and/or stakeholders
 ■ Products
 ■ Competitive advantage
 ■ Values provided to customer
 ■ Markets or industry
3.2 The Mission Statement
The mission statement for a new venture more completely describes the organi-
zation’s goals and customers, while incorporating the basic tenets of the vision 
statement. A vision is an imaginative picture of the future, while a mission is a 
description of the course of action to implement the vision. The mission of an 
organization is lofty and audacious. It provides for a theory of change.
The potential elements of a mission statement are shown in Table 3.3. Most 
mission statements include only some of these elements. For example, the mis-
sion statement of eBay is given in Table 3.4.
Most mission statements are short—fewer than 100 words. The mission state-
ment should be a concise, clear explanation of the purpose, values, product, and 
customer. The eBay statement, for example, clearly describes that venture’s mis-
sion. An example of a concise yet clear mission statement for an electronics firm 
might be: “Our mission is to design and manufacture electronic devices that serve 
the needs of the  aerospace industry on a timely basis and at reasonable prices.”

3.3   The Value Proposition 55
A good mission statement can help align all the stakeholders and provide a 
rationale for allocating resources. If possible, the mission statement should be 
developed by the entrepreneurial team with other employees. Table 3.5 shows the 
mission statement for Genentech. This statement is very complete and describes 
its commitment to all its stakeholders—customers, employees, and community.
TABLE 3.4 Mission statement of eBay.
We help people trade practically anything on earth. eBay was founded with the belief that 
people are basically good. We believe that each of our customers, whether a buyer or a seller, 
is an individual who deserves to be treated with respect.
We will continue to enhance the online trading experiences of all—collectors, hobbyists, 
dealers, small business, unique item seekers, bargain hunters, opportunistic sellers, and brows-
ers. The growth of the eBay community comes from meeting and exceeding the expectations 
of these special people. 
TABLE 3.5 Mission statement of Genentech.
Our mission is to be the leading biotechnology company, using human genetic information to 
discover, develop, manufacture, and commercialize biotherapeutics that address significant 
unmet medical needs. We commit ourselves to high standards of integrity in contributing to 
the best interests of patients, the medical profession, our employees, and our  communities, and 
to seeking significant returns to our stockholders, based on the continual pursuit of  scientific 
and operational excellence.
TABLE 3.6 Five values offered to a customer.
 1. Product: Performance, quality, features, brand, selection, search, easy to use, safe
 2. Price: Fair, visible, consistent, reasonable
 3. Access: Convenient, location, nearby, at-hand, easy to find, in a reasonable time
 4. Service: Ordering, delivery, return, check-out
 5. Experience: Emotional, respect, ambiance, fun, intimacy, relationships, community
3.3 The Value Proposition
Value delivered to the customer results in a satisfied customer who will pay a 
reasonable price in return for the product or service. Value is the worth, impor-
tance, or usefulness to the customer. In business terms, value is the worth in mon-
etary terms of the social and economic benefits a customer receives from paying 
for a product or service. To be successful, firms must offer products that meet the 
needs and values of the customer. The needs of the customer often include ease of 
locating or accessing the product as well as its qualities and features.
The five key values held by a customer can be summarized as product, price, 
access, service, and experience. Table 3.6 lists these five values, along with spe-
cific descriptors for each value. Price, for example, can have high value to the 
customer when it is fair, visible, and consistent. A product may have value if it

CHAPTER 3   Vision and the Business Model56
has high performance and quality, and is easy to find and use. Most technology-
based products are initially focused on performance and functionality [Markides 
and Geroski, 2005].
The value proposition defines the company to the customer. Most value 
propositions can be described using the five key values. Crawford and Matthews 
have shown that one value is selected to dominate the value proposition offered 
to the customer. A second value differentiates the offering, and the remaining 
three values must meet the industry norm [Crawford and Matthews, 2001]. Con-
sider a performance rating on a 1-to-5 scale where 5 is world-class, 1 is unac-
ceptable, and 3 is  industry par. Crawford states that a venture should plan a good 
product offering to have a value score of 5, 4, 3, 3, 3 for its five value proposition 
attributes in the  following order: dominant, differentiating, norm, norm, norm.
Consider Wal-Mart, where price is the dominant value of its offering. Wal-
Mart differentiates itself on product in terms of selection and quality. By con-
trast, the values offered by Target are dominated by product and differentiated 
by price. Many firms focus on good service, which is about human interaction. 
For example, Honda has great service as its dominant value, and its secondary, 
 differentiating value is product.
Access can be described by ease of locating, connecting to, and then navi-
gating the physical or virtual facility of a business. Very good accessibility is 
offered by Amazon.com, and its website is relatively easy to navigate. Acces-
sibil ity can also be described as convenience or expedience. For a customer with 
a  high demand for time, convenience is very important. A readily accessible 
 website can be very valuable to a time-starved customer.
Zappos.com sells shoes and other clothing and accessories through its web-
site. The company is known for providing an excellent customer experience. 
According to Zappos, “Customer service isn’t just a department, it is the entire 
company.” As a result, the company has a 75 percent repeat business rate, and 
enjoys a very good reputation through word-of-mouth referrals. 
Apple realized that by opening retail stores, it could make buying its prod-
ucts more of a recreational experience. Apple Stores provide a place to gather 
casually and learn how to do interesting things with Apple products. Custom-
ers can do everything from buying a computer or phone to learning how to 
record their own music to interacting with other Apple aficionados. As impor-
tant, these extra services that Apple Stores provide are complimentary to all 
customers.
Most customers seek a provider of a product or service who saves them time, 
charges a reasonable price, makes it easy to find exactly what they want, delivers 
where they ask, pays attention to them, lets them shop when they want to, and 
makes it a pleasurable experience. Any firm that fashions a value proposition to 
that set of customer values and actually delivers on that promise should do well.
The product value is described by its performance, range of selection, abil-
ity to search for it, and quality. V olvo built its business on the idea of product 
safety. V olvo became the first car company to offer three-point, lap and shoulder 
seat belts. Home Depot focuses on providing a very wide selection of quality

 products. The differentiating (secondary) value for Home Depot is its service. 
The  primary and secondary values for selected leading firms are shown in 
Table 3.7.
One value of product is range of selection or choice. Often to appeal to 
many different customers, a firm offers many versions of a product. However, 
too much choice is often debilitating [Schwartz, 2004]. If a firm offers extensive 
choice, it should help the customer search and select the right version. Amazon 
and TiV o offer such help to their customers.
Remember, a firm must meet at par the three remaining variables. Consider 
the plight of today’s department stores. Their primary value is product selection. 
However, they are struggling to be accessible to today’s shopper and just be at 
par on service, price, and experience.

Google’s Value Proposition
What are the primary and secondary values for Google? It offers product 
as its primary value with fast, relevant results for the most ill-described 
inquiry. Its secondary value is access, which is embodied in the easy online 
connection right to the search page without annoying pages or advertise-
ments obscuring the search box.
In general, the more value, V , customers place on a firm’s products, the 
higher price, P, the company can charge for these products. The cost of producing 
the products is C, and the profit margin is P 2 C. The company profits as long as 
P . C. The value created is V 2 C, and the net value to the customer is V  2 P .

CHAPTER 3   Vision and the Business Model58
These relationships can be portrayed as shown in Figure 3.3. The most powerful 
new venture provides a great sense of value at a reasonable price, resulting in a 
high ration of value to price for the customer.
American Express invented the traveler’s check as a means of getting money 
while traveling abroad. The value to the customer was high. The cost to issue 
the checks was low, and (V 2 P) remained high to the customer. All parties have 
been pleased with this business model for more than 100 years [Magretta, 2002].
The value proposition states who the customer is and describes the val-
ues offered to this customer. The value proposition for Amazon.com could be 
de scribed as:
An easily accessible Internet site that is always convenient and provides a wide 
selection of products at a fair price to the busy, computer-literate customer.
The value proposition for Starbucks could be described as:
A friendly, comfortable, well-located café offering a wide range of fresh, 
customized quality coffees, teas, and other beverages for the person who 
enjoys a good experience and a good beverage.
Home Depot and Lowe’s stores are the two large home-improvement chains 
in the United States. Home Depot’s dominant value is product selection, and its 
secondary value is service. Lowe’s has a dominant value of accessibility and 
a secondary value of product selection. These value differences lead to clearly 
separate value propositions offered to the customers of these two competitors.
The unique selling proposition (USP) is a short version of a firm’s value 
proposition and is often used as a slogan or summary phrase to explain the key 
benefits of the firm’s offering versus that of a key competitor. For example, 
Hewlett-Packard uses a USP as follows:
Excellent technical products with reliable service at a fair price.
Value, V
C
Price, P
V–P
P–C
Cost, C

3.4   The Business Model 59
The clear, simple USP for FedEx is:
Positively, absolutely overnight.
USPs are useful for succinctly describing a new venture to would-be investors, 
customers, or team members. 
New ventures can use their value proposition and unique selling proposition 
to clarify the business values offered to the customer. This will help all stake-
holders understand the purpose of the firm’s business concept.
TABLE 3.8 Elements of a business model.
 ■ Customer selection: Who is the customer?
Is our offering relevant to this customer?
 ■ Value proposition: What are the unique benefits?
 ■ Differentiation and 
control:
How do we protect our cash flow and relationships?
Do we have a sustainable competitive advantage?
 ■ Scope of product and 
activities:
What is the scope of our product activities?
What activities do we do, and what do we outsource?
 ■ Organizational design: What is the organizational architecture of the firm?
 ■ Value capture for profit: How does the firm capture some of the total value for profit?
How does the firm protect this profitability?
 ■ Value for talent: Why will good people choose to work here?
How will we leverage their talent?
3.4 The Business Model
The design of a business is the means for delivering value to customers and earn-
ing a profit from that activity. The business design incorporates the selection of 
customers, its offerings, the tasks it will do itself and those it will outsource, and 
how it will capture profits. A successful business design represents an improve-
ment over existing alternatives. It also functions like a story, which can be used 
to attract investors, customers, and team members.
A good business design addresses what the venture will and will not do 
and how the venture will create a sound value proposition. The business design 
answers three key questions: who is the customer, how are the needs of the cus-
tomer satisfied, and how are the profits captured and profitability protected. The 
resulting outcome of the business design process is the business model, which is 
an integrated description of a new venture’s unique customer value proposition 
and of how the venture will configure its resources and activities to deliver that 
value and to earn sustainable profits [Eisenmann, 2012]. A business model is the 
framework that connects a technology-based solution to economic profits.
Table 3.8 depicts the elements of a business model. A description of a  business 
model for Apple is given in Table 3.9. The first critical element of a busi-
ness model is the selection of the customer. The business design aims to specify 
the  customers with unmet or latent needs, which will then define the target mar-
ket. Apple succeeds by focusing on customers who are less cost-conscious and 
willing to pay a premium for Apple products.

CHAPTER 3   Vision and the Business Model60
The second element is a clear and unique value proposition that addresses 
the identified market segment. The business model also should describe the ven-
ture’s differentiation, which is the third element. For example, Apple sells pre-
mium product with leading-edge technologies that are easy and fun to use.
The fourth and fifth elements explain the scope of product and activities, 
and the organizational design that will enable you to implement the value propo-
sition. Finally, the sixth and seventh elements explain how you will capture value 
for profit and how you will attract and leverage talent. A clear path to profit-
ability is critical. You should determine your company’s actual and projected 
revenues and expenses, identifying the key factors that influence total revenues 
and costs. Then, plot cash flow versus time to determine your financing needs 
[Hamermesh et al., 2002]. More on this process is detailed in Chapter 17.
Furthermore, it is important that you can retain good profit margins so that 
you can invest for the future. For example, Apple controls both the hardware and 
software components of its products, which enables not only superior integration 
but also an increased ability to demand significant price concessions from its 
suppliers. By contrast, it is best to avoid competing solely on price and making 
low price the dominant value of the value proposition. Those companies that do 
make price the dominant value, such as Wal-Mart, Costco, Dollar General, and 
Family Dollar, are careful to differentiate themselves along other dimensions, 
too. Dollar General and Family Dollar use smaller stores in well-located strip 
malls so that accessibility is their differentiating value. Wal-Mart and Costco 
compete on the product quality and selection as their secondary value. The 
TABLE 3.9 Apple business model.
 ■ Customer selection: 
High relevance
Target customer is the consumer who values breakthrough 
technology and world-class user interface over open 
standards.
 ■ Value proposition: 
Unique benefits
Seamless integration of products and services, intuitive inter-
faces, elegant designs.
 ■ Differentiation and 
control: Sustainable 
competitive advantage
Control over both hardware and software, critical mass in 
App Store, constant innovation, and strong intellectual 
property protection.
 ■ Scope of product and 
activities
Desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, cloud based 
 services, customized devices for experiencing media, and 
an applications store with many applications developed by 
third parties.
 ■ Organizational design Engineering and design are valued above all other disci-
plines. Marketing is used to create a culture around what it 
means to be an Apple user.
 ■ Value capture for profit Premium price charged for a premium product. Tight control 
over manufacturing leads to greater product margins and 
differentiated product.
 ■ Value for talent: Opportunity to work with a world-chanigng company and 
with some of the best and brightest engineers.

3.4   The Business Model 61
business model of Wal-Mart is successful because of its use of technology to 
achieve strong supply-chain management and store inventory control.
Southwest Airlines is another example of a business with price as the domi-
nant value in its value proposition. Its secondary value is service: on-time arrival 
and departure, online ticket ordering, and a customer-friendly attitude. It captures 
profit from the valued service by controlling costs. It uses one type of aircraft, 
which keeps its costs of maintenance and training lower than its competitors’. It 
also heavily promotes the online sales of tickets. As a result, Southwest has been 
profitable every year since 1973 [Freiberg and Freiberg, 1997]. The business 
model of Southwest Airlines is compared with the business model of American 
Airlines in Table 3.10.
Alex Osterwalder has proposed a compelling visualization of the business 
model, “the business model canvas,” as depicted in Figure 3.4 [Blank, 2013]. 
In Osterwalder’s canvas, an organization’s business model is depicted using nine 
building blocks: (1) customer segments, (2) the value proposition for each seg-
ment, (3) channels to reach customers, (4) customer relationships, (5) revenue 
streams, (6) key resources required to create value, (7) key activities required 
to create value, (8) key partnerships, and (9) the cost structure. A key feature of 
the business model canvas is that it highlights the relationships between these 
elements. Thus, it is not enough to simply describe each element independently; 
instead,  entrepreneurs also should focus on the ways in which the elements rein-
force one another to form a coherent and robust business model. 
Successful entrepreneurs treat the business model itself as an opportunity to 
be innovative [Zott and Amit, 2007]. For example, the success of Apple’s iPod

CHAPTER 3   Vision and the Business Model62
depended in large part upon Apple’s use of a novel business model. By combin-
ing hardware, software, and service, Apple provided customers with significant 
value—and realized record-breaking profits [Johnson et al., 2008]. 
Almost every aspiring entrepreneur assumes that his or her initial busi-
ness model (Plan A) will be successful. Empirically, however, most Plan A’s 
fail [Mullins and Komisar, 2009]. PayPal, for example, morphed from infrared 
beaming of cash between PDAs to its current model based on online transac-
tions tied to sites like eBay. Good entrepreneurs, therefore, test the hypotheses 
and assumptions embedded in their business model. Based upon data, they then 
adjust their business model [Ries, 2011]. As Figure 3.5 illustrates, the business 
design process, therefore, is iterative and is responsive to changing conditions 
and to new data.

3.5 Business Model Innovation in 
Challenging Markets
Changing market conditions can signal that a firm’s business model should also 
change. For example, a firm may have an opportunity to address the needs of 
large groups who find existing solutions too expensive or complicated, to capi-
talize on new technology, or to leverage existing technology in a new market. 
Alternatively, a firm may find that it needs to fend off low-end disrupters or to 
respond to shifts in competition. In all of these cases, a business model change 
may be needed [Johnson et al., 2008].

CHAPTER 3   Vision and the Business Model64
Business model innovation is the capacity to reconceive existing business 
models in new ways that create new value for customers [Hamel, 2000]. 
Monster.com, Indeed, and Simply Hired have introduced new ways of 
searching for jobs, with hundreds of thousands of listings across the country. 
Salesforce.com pioneered the Software as a Service (SaaS) model that enables 
customers to pay for their customer relationship management software on a 
monthly subscription basis and to run it on Salesforce.com’s own systems. This 
approach has become the preferred method by which many companies now buy 
their software. As of January 2013, Salesforce.com had a market capitalization 
of $20 billion. Many other companies have copied the SaaS model for other 
applications. For example, Workday, which went public in 2012 and has a mar-
ket capitalization of $8 billion, sells financial and human resources software as 
a service.
Existing ventures should also engage in business model innovation as 
markets change. For example, Hewlett-Packard, which was founded in 1938, 
changed its model to become America’s premier brand for computer printers. 
Amazon.com started as a bookseller, but it now looks like the Wal-Mart of the 
Internet. Gas stations have evolved into convenience stores selling beverages, 
food, newspapers, and fuel.
Netflix is a prime example of a company that creatively destroyed video 
rental retail stores by offering to mail videos directly to the customer’s home. 
Netflix was thus able to offer greater convenience and hundreds of thousands 
of titles. Retail video rental stores like Blockbuster, which went out of business, 
could not match Netflix for convenience or selection. Then as higher bandwidth 
speeds made it possible to download movies over the web, Netflix in 2012 found 
itself competing with a new set of players like Amazon and Apple, who were 
enabling customers to download movies to tablets and e-readers. Soon, all of the 
players in this industry will need to figure out a strategy for delivering movies 
to web-connected televisions. The dynamic marketplace for movie rentals will 
continue to offer significant promise as well as significant risk.
Kiva Systems Uses Robots to Forever Change How Warehouses Operate
Kiva Systems uses robots to pick, pack, and ship products from ware-
houses. These large warehouses used to be dependent upon manual labor 
to store, move, and sort product inventories. With Kiva Systems, it has 
become economical to manage larger inventories and inventories with 
many more product lines. In addition to the labor savings, companies save 
money because Kiva Systems uses analytics to optimize product place-
ment within warehouses. Thus, companies can ship up to four times as 
many packages as they could with traditional labor. Companies like Office 
Depot, Toys R Us, Crate & Barrel, and Timberland are able to operate 
more efficiently and at lower costs due to Kiva’s innovations.

3.6 Spotlight on Stratasys
S. Scott Crump and his wife Lisa Crump founded Stratasys Inc. in 1989. Stratasys 
manufactures additive fabrication (3D printing) machines that deposit layers of 
plastic, which build up to become prototype models. Stratasys devices enable 
engineers and designers to create physical models and prototypes directly from 
their computer-aided-design workstations. Stratasys merged with Israel-based 
Objet Ltd. in 2012 in order to increase entry to potential markets. 
Stratasys’ value proposition is that it enables faster and cheaper manufactur-
ing of prototypes and low-volume products. Stratasys has a powerful business 
model based on attractive costs, a wide range of users, and few competitors. 
Stratasys offers lease or rent systems and maintenance services. Their custom-
ers include aerospace, medical, automotive, electronics, and consumer products 
firms. Stratasys has utilized a merger and acquisition strategy to grow quickly 
and to become a leader in an emerging industry.
3.7 Summary
The theory of a business is a description of the elements required for the entre-
preneur to act to build a business that satisfies the customers’ needs. Coupled 
with the firm’s core competencies and resources, the firm uses the elements of 
its business design to build a sustainable competitive advantage. The elements 
of a firm’s theory of its business include: vision, mission, value proposition, and 
business model.
 ■ Great vision is a statement of purpose (or story) in response to an 
opportunity.
 ■ The mission describes the firm’s goals, products, and customers, providing 
a theory of change for all to see.
 ■ The value proposition describes customer needs that will be satisfied.
 ■ The business model describes the economics and activities of the new 
 enterprise.

How can a venture create a strategy to fit the 
new business opportunity?
E
very new venture has a strategy or approach to 
achieve its goals. This strategy is in response to 
its plan to implement a solution to an impor-
tant problem or opportunity. The process for creating 
a strategy for a new firm is shown in Table 4.1. Step 
1 was described in Chapter 3. With sound vision and 
mission statements and an initial business model, the 
entrepreneur identifies the venture’s core competen-
cies and examines the political and economic context 
of the industry (steps 2 and 3). Once the industry is 
understood, steps 4 and 5 are used to describe the 
firm’s strengths and weaknesses and its opportunities 
and threats (SWOT). In step 6, the entrepreneur inte-
grates his or her knowledge of the industry and com-
petitors with his or her own SWOT to identify key 
success factors. Based on the information gathered 
in the preceding steps, the entrepreneur refines his or 
her vision, mission, and business model and creates a 
strategy to achieve a sustainable competitive advan-
tage. The formation of cooperative alliances with 
other enterprises can be an important way for a new 
venture to position itself within an industry. Long-
term success depends upon addressing the needs of all 
stakeholders and acting in a responsible manner.

CHAPTER 4   Competitive Strategy68
TABLE 4.1 Management process for developing a strategy.
1.  Develop the vision and mission statements, and the business model.
2.  Describe the firm’s core competencies.
3.  Describe the industry and context for the firm and its competitors.
4.   Determine the firm’s strengths and weaknesses in the context of the industry and 
environment.
5.  Describe the opportunities and threats for the venture.
6.  Identify the key factors for success.
7.  Formulate strategic options and select the appropriate strategy.
8.  Translate the strategy into action plans with suitable measures and controls.
A strategy is a plan or road map of the actions that a firm or organization will 
take to achieve its mission and goals. To be useful, the plan must be action- 
oriented and based on the firm’s opportunities, strengths, and competencies. The 
strategy also should be simple and clear, so that everyone in the organization 
can follow a commonly understood plan. The desired outcome of a strategy is a 
sustainable competitive performance.
A strategy is a response to opportunity. The word opportunity is derived 
from the Latin expression “toward the port.” The builder of value is like a mer-
chant sea captain who secures the right payloads from the best customers, man-
ages his crew, and adjusts his mix of established ports and new ports with high 
potential [McGrath et al., 2001]. Thus, the formulation of a sound strategy is 
based on deep knowledge of the opportunity, the industry, and its context.
In describing the opportunity as a vision, a sense of drama and vitality 
emerges. With this vitality, the entrepreneur motivates the team and the investors 
to share the vision, embrace the strategy, and act on it.
Strategies help to set a firm on a course and then focus their efforts on it. 
In fact, for some, the essence of strategy is choosing what not to do [Magretta, 
2002]. Often, a strategy emerges as actions are taken and tested, eventually con-
verging toward a pattern [Mintzberg et al., 1998].
Because of the dynamic nature of the competitive business world, long-term 
planning is very difficult and the strategy also should be dynamic. Industries 
are not in equilibrium, and industry analysis is difficult. For example, it is hard 
to define where an industry begins and ends, and it is difficult to distinguish 
competitors from collaborators from suppliers. Thus, all strategies are subject to 
change and reemergence as conditions, alliances, and competition change.
Table 4.1 summarizes the process for developing a strategy. Entrepreneurs 
start in the center of Figure 4.1 by building and aligning their capabilities, 
resources, and products. They then act on their initial strategy or business plan. 
Entry into the competitive marketplace will force a reassessment of the mar-
ketplace and industry as well as their competitor analysis. This leads strategic

managers to redeploy and adjust the capabilities, resources, products, and actions 
to effectively compete in the dynamic market. These managers strive to attain a 
competitive advantage by securing and managing the assets of the firm. How the 
internal management responds to a changing customer, industry, and competi-
tion is crucial in the reestablishment of the strategic plan and the firm’s assets to 
act competitively. Venture leaders strive to identify the fundamental forces for 
creating and capturing customer value. Those ventures that focus on continu-
ously adjusting and aligning their strategy and capabilities will constantly evolve 
from one strategic position to the next strategic position in response to changing 
conditions.
GE Aircraft Engines (GEAE) provides an example of an adjustment in a 
strategic plan as a result of changes in the market. GEAE had a product  strategy 
to develop engines with more power, efficiency, and better reliability. Because 
of relentless competition and shorter product cycles, sustaining profitability was 
difficult. GEAE shifted to operating as an engine production and services pro-
vider, generating significant profits in the after-market  services business [Demos 
et al., 2002]. Faced with a dynamic marketplace, the strategic leader develops a 
strategic response and adapts to the changes in the market.
To summarize Figure 4.1, the first step is to determine the basic driving 
forces in the industry: the economic, demographic, technological, or competitive 
factors that either constitute threats or create opportunities. The second step is 
to formulate a strategy that addresses the driving forces identified in step 1. The 
third step is to create a plan to implement the new strategy. Finally, the new strat-
egy is implemented by building and realigning the firm’s capabilities, resources, 
and products.

CHAPTER 4   Competitive Strategy70
Entrepreneurs define their strategy within their perception of oppor-
tunity. They are not constrained by the present resources or capabilities but 
seek to acquire the necessary resources and capabilities. The theory of 
resource dependence states that a company’s freedom of action is limited to 
satisfying the needs of customers and investors that give it the resources to 
survive [Christensen, 1999]. Investors and customers dictate how money 
will be spent because companies that do not satisfy them will be unable to 
 survive.
The six questions for creating a sound, dynamic strategy appear in Figure 4.2. 
With solid, effective answers to these six questions, a firm will have formed a 
strategy that has the potential to lead to profitability.
The development of a strategy often uses reasoning by analogy [Gavetti and 
Rivkin, 2005]. For example, Staples began by asking: “Could we be the Toys-R-Us 
of office supplies?” Analogical reasoning makes efficient use of information, 
but can be misleading if built on superficial similarities and inaccurate informa-
tion. Thus, it is important to understand the source of the analogy and check the 
similarities.
Ultimately, a strategy can be viewed as a plan that integrates a firm’s 
goals and actions into a cohesive whole that draws effectively on its 
resources and capabilities. The essence of strategy is choosing the priorities 
and deciding what to do and what not to do. The strategic priorities deter-
mine how a business is positioned relative to the alternatives. As the competi-
tive conditions change, the new venture adjusts its strategy to meet the new 
conditions.

4.2   Core Competencies 71
The core competencies of a firm are its unique capabilities and resources that 
enable it to implement its business model and thus deliver a valuable product 
or service to its customers. A capability is the capacity of the firm, or a team 
within the firm, to perform some task or activity. Thus, the capabilities of a firm 
include the collective learning in the organization, the skills of its people, and its 
capabilities to coordinate and integrate know-how and proprietary  knowledge. 
Resources are human, physical, financial, and organizational, and include pat-
ents, brand, know-how, and capital. It is the usefulness of both capabilities and 
resources in a coordinated way that leads to distinctive core competencies – those 
activities that a firm does better than its competitors. 
To be competitive, a firm must have: (1) unique and valuable resources and 
the capability to exploit these resources, or (2) a unique capability to manage 
common resources. Intel possesses unique patent and know-how resources and 
the capabilities to exploit that knowledge and intellectual property. Ryanair and 
Southwest possess common resources – aircraft and aircraft equipment – but 
have unique capabilities to manage these resources. Disney has unique resources 
in its film library, brand, and theme parks but a mixed record of managing 
them well.
Core competencies are the critical asset of a technology venture. Unlike 
physical assets, core competencies do not deteriorate as they are applied and 
shared. In fact, they can grow as a firm learns to build its competencies. For 
example, the core competency of Intel is the ability to design and manufacture 
integrated circuits for computers and communication systems. The core compe-
tencies of 3M are in designing and manufacturing materials, coatings, and adhe-
sives, and devising various ways of combining them for new, valuable products. 
Ideally, a firm’s core competencies will be rare, difficult for others to imitate, 
and difficult to substitute.
Core competencies provide potential access to a wide variety of markets. 
For example, Honda’s core competencies in engines and power trains have 
enabled it to provide distinctive products for lawnmowers, motorcycles, auto-
mobiles, and electric generators. Core competencies are the wellspring of new 
business ventures.
It is very important that the core competencies of a firm match the require-
ments of its business. Firms with core competencies that match those necessary 
to effectively implement their business model have the best chance to succeed. 
For example, the core competency of Google is the design and operation of 
massively scaled Web services. It is the dominant online search engine. After 
starting as a search tool for finding information on diverse subjects, it also has 
become the leader in the Internet advertising industry.
We care about competencies since they are the roots of competitive advan-
tage, as Section 4.6 will explain. Competitive advantage also depends, however, 
upon the firm’s industry and context, as we discuss in the next section.

CHAPTER 4   Competitive Strategy72
A full description of the customer and the industry will help the entrepreneur 
build a sound strategic plan. The main elements of an industry analysis are 
given in Table 4.2. The first step is to accurately name and describe the indus-
try in which the firm is or will be operating. The definition should be  narrow 
and focused. An industry is a group of firms producing products that are close 
substitutes for each other and serve the same customers. Thus, selecting the 
telecommunications industry may be too broad. The definition of the industry 
should be more focused, such as “the Internet service provider industry serv-
ing homes and businesses in Ohio and Indiana.” If data are not available for the 
targeted area of the market, the closest proxy should be used. For example, if sta-
tistics are not available for Ohio and Indiana, they may be available for the Mid-
west or the United States. Then, define this market and describe the customer. 
The second step is to describe the regulatory and legal issues within the industry. 
Both national, as well as state and local regulations, should be considered. Also, 
changes in regulations can influence both industry-funding trends and particular 
types of companies within an industry [Sine et al., 2005].
The third step of Table 4.2 suggests describing the growth rate and state 
of evolution of the industry. Most industries tend to emerge through an initial 
period of slow growth with limited sales and few competitors. Then, they expand 
through a period of rapid growth as sales take off and many firms enter the indus-
try. This is followed by a third period of maturation marked by slower growth 
and stability. Eventually, the number of firms in the industry declines [Low and 
Abrahamson, 1997]. We depict in Table 4.3 these four stages as (1) emergence, 
(2) growth, (3) maturation, and (4) decline. It is important to know where your 
industry is in the evolution cycle. In the emerging phase, significant product and 
market uncertainty exists. Producers are unsure of what features are required 
for the product. Customers may be unsure of the elements of the product they 
need. Many technology ventures begin in the emerging phase of an industry. For 
a technology venture, an emerging industry will not yet have a dominant design 
and will respond well to new firms with a wealth of knowledge that can be used 
to build a powerful new venture [Shane, 2005].
The growth stage emerges when the necessary features and perfor mance 
become clear and a dominant design emerges. A dominant design is one 
whose major components and core concepts do not substantially vary from one

prod uct offering to another. With the emergence of a dominant design, the num-
ber of  competitors stabilizes.
Eventually, an industry enters its mature phase as the number of competi-
tors stabilizes and profit margins slowly decline as price becomes the primary 
competitive weapon. Finally, an industry enters a declining phase as the  number 
of firms decline and profit margins erode.
The personal computer market began in 1978, with a number of small, 
emerging firms such as Apple Computer. IBM entered the personal computer 
market in 1982, and its PC quickly emerged as the dominant design. Many other 
firms entered after IBM made the design open to all, and the PC industry expe-
rienced a growth phase between 1984 and 1998. Eventually, the  market reached 
a period of maturity, with only a few dominant firms having  standardized or 
slightly differentiated products and relatively stable sales and market shares.
Table 4.2 shows that the next step in the industry analysis is a statement of 
the profit potential and the typical return on investment capital in the industry. 
The return on capital is defined as the ratio of profit to the total invested capi-
tal of a firm. The average return on capital in the computer software industry is 
about 16 percent, while the return on capital in the steel industry is about 6 per-
cent. The steel industry is less attractive, while the computer software industry is 
attractive. One of the most effective ways to identify realistic profit opportuni-
ties for a new venture is to look at the Securities Exchange Commission filings 
of a young representative firm in the industry (www.sec.gov).
The six forces model, shown in Figure 4.3, is one popular method for 
evaluating the competitive forces in an industry. The six forces are: (1) firm 
rivalry, (2) threat of entry by new competitors, (3) threat of substitute  products,

CHAPTER 4   Competitive Strategy74
(4) bargaining power of customers, (5) bargaining power of complementors, and 
(6) bargaining power of suppliers. This framework is an extension of the five 
forces model [Porter, 1998]. The six forces model enables the analyst to con-
sider all the issues facing a new entrant by describing the key industry factors. 
The rivalry among the industry competitors may be intense or modest. In some 
industries, the bargaining power of the  customer may be modest.
Consider the automobile industry, which has about 10 competitors. The 
rivalry is extremely intense. The bargaining power of customers regarding a new 
vehicle is very high since they have access to broad information on the rela-
tive performance and price of the products of the competitive companies and 
their dealers. The bargaining power of the suppliers in the industry is  modest. 
 Furthermore, the threat of a substitute product is small. The threat of new 
entrants is very small, due to the costs of developing a new product and dealer 
network. Thus, the auto industry experiences intense competition with the buyer 
wielding significant power.
Consider the online bookselling industry: Amazon.com and Barnesand-
Noble.com are the two large online booksellers in the United States, but there

are many regional competitors such as Powells.com. The rivalry among these 
competitors is high. Their suppliers have low bargaining power, and the barriers 
to entry are moderate. The bargaining power of the customer is large, result-
ing in low prices, and profitability is modest. The threat of substitute products 
is low. However, e-books could undermine the printed book industry as more 
attractive devices emerge such as Amazon’s Kindle.
By contrast, many new firms enter the computer software industry each 
year. The bargaining power of customers is moderate, and the threat of substitute 
products is low. As a result, profitability in the industry is high. However, the 
rivalry of the firms is intense.
A competitive analysis explains how you will do better than your rivals. 
And doing better, by definition, means being different. Organizations achieve 
superior performance when they are unique, when they do something no other 
business does in ways that no other business can duplicate. In military competi-
tion, strategy refers to the large-scale plan for how the generals intend to fight 
and win a war. The word tactics, in contrast, refers to small-scale operations, such 
as the conduct of a single battle [Clemons and Santamaria, 2002]. Very few stra-
tegic plans survive the first contact with competitors. Competitors respond and 
change the situation.
Complementors are companies that sell complements to the enterprise’s 
own product offerings. A complement is a product that improves or perfects 
another product. For example, the complementors to Sony’s PlayStation 4 and 
Nintendo’s Wii are the companies that produce the video games that run on these 
consoles.  Without an adequate supply of complementary products, demand for 
the player product would be modest. Complements to the automobile include the 
interstate road system that enables automobiles to safely and rapidly travel long 
distances and the large number of dispersed filling stations that enable conve-
nient refueling. By contrast, without suitable, widely located electric recharge 
stations, the future of electric vehicles may be very limited.
The bargaining power of the suppliers depends, in part, on the number of 
suppliers and buyers. When the supplier industry is composed of many small 
companies and the buyers are few and large, the buyers tend to dominate the 
supply companies. An example is the automotive component supply industry, 
in which the buyers are few and large and dominate the many small suppliers.
The entrepreneurial firm is likely to be a new entrant to the industry. Thus, 
the new venture should describe the barriers to entry, the threat of substitutes, 
and the bargaining power of the suppliers, customers, and complementors. One 
of the main factors that drives traditional analyses of the determinants of market 
structure involves comparing the size that a firm must be to compete efficiently 
to the overall size of the market in which it competes. If the industry has few 
firms, a new firm may be able to readily enter and gain market share. Using 
the six forces model, a new technology venture is likely to perform better when 
it operates in an industry with high barriers to entry, low rivalry, low threat of 
substitutes, low buyer power, low supplier power, and low bargaining power of 
complementors.

CHAPTER 4   Competitive Strategy76
To complete the industry analysis, it will be necessary to name the competi-
tors and describe the profitability of the industry. One method is to use Standard 
and Poors Reports or the Value Line Investment Survey. For example, if the 
new firm is entering the biomedical devices industry, the leading competitors 
are Medtronic and Boston Scientific. Using Value Line, we note that the aver-
age return on total invested capital for these companies is 15 percent. Value Line 
projects a 13 percent future growth rate of sales for this industry. With these 
attractive measures, the industry appears to be very attractive to new entrants 
with well-differentiated, fairly priced products.

TABLE 4.4 SWOT analysis for Amgen.
Organizational (internal) Environmental (external)  
4.4 SWOT Analysis
Steps 4 and 5 of the management process for developing a strategic plan 
(Table 4.1) suggest that a strategy is based on the firm’s strengths and opportuni-
ties, while avoiding or mitigating its weaknesses and managing threats. As dis-
cussed in chapters 2 and 3, a new firm is focused on securing the capabilities and 
resources necessary to succeed in its industry. Furthermore, the new firm con-
centrates on an attractive opportunity that was selected using Table 2.6. Thus, 
a strategy addresses the four aspects of the setting in which a firm operates: 
(1) a firm’s strengths, (2) its weaknesses, (3) the opportunities, and (4) the threats 
in its competitive environment. This analysis is often called a SWOT analysis, 
which allows a firm to match its strengths and weaknesses with opportunities 
and threats and find the purpose for which it is best suited.
A firm’s strengths are its resources and capabilities. Its weaknesses are its 
limitations of organization or lack of capabilities or resources. A firm’s oppor-
tunities are its chances for success in a new entry or product in its industry. The 
threats are actions or events outside its control in the competitive environment.
A basic SWOT analysis for Amgen, a leading biopharmaceutical company, 
is given in Table 4.4. The SWOT  analysis provides the questions for a strategic

response and helps a firm exploit its strengths, avoid or fix its weaknesses, seize 
its good opportunities, and mitigate its threats. Examples of threats are market 
shifts, regulatory changes, and delays in product development. Positive opportu-
nities include increasing demand, repeated use, and willingness to pay.
We can examine opportunities in three dimensions, as shown in Figure 4.4. 
Perhaps the safest strategy is to take new products to existing customers via 
existing distribution channels using existing approaches. We can call the three 
dimensions: products, customers, and approach [Black and Gregersen, 2002]. 
Approach is the method or means of taking the product to the customer. The 
most risky  strat egy would be a new product taken to new customers via a new 
approach.  Amazon.com started selling books (existing products) to book buyers 
(existing customers) via a new approach—online.
4.5 Barriers to Entry
Barriers to entry are factors that make it costly for companies to enter an indus-
try. The greater the costs that potential competitors must bear to enter an indus-
try, the greater are the barriers to entry. The six potential barriers to entry are in 
Table 4.5. Economies of scale can be a barrier in industries where the costs of 
production are low for a narrow range of volume or occur only for higher vol-
umes. An example is the aircraft design and production industry. It is difficult 
to enter that industry since a low volume of production of aircraft is most likely 
uneconomic for the new entrant [Barney, 2002].
Cost advantages independent of scale may be held by existing companies 
and will deter a new company from entering. For example, incumbent firms 
bye23429_ch04_067-098.indd   77bye23429_ch04_067-098.indd   77 12/2/13   11:46 AM12/2/13   11:46 AM

CHAPTER 4   Competitive Strategy78
may have proprietary technology, know-how, favorable geographic locations, 
and learning-curve advantages. These can all be barriers to a new entrant.
Product differentiation means that incumbent firms possess brand identifi-
cation and customer loyalty that serve as barriers to new entrants. For example, 
Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and Apple have brand and customer loyalty, making it 
difficult for a new personal computer company to enter the industry on a large 
scale. Of course, this barrier may be less important to a specialty manufacturer 
that seeks a small niche in the personal computer market. A formidable barrier 
to entry is the reputation or brand equity of the incumbents. Providing  ratings 
for bonds is an attractive industry since it is not asset-intensive and the profit 
margins are very good. If a new firm tries to enter this market, however, it will 
have to compete with Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s, both competitors with 
strong reputations.
Contrived deterrence as a barrier occurs when incumbent firms strive to 
throw up unnatural barriers at a cost to them. They can use lower prices, newer 
products, or brand building to send a signal to potential entrants that intense 
responses will result if they try to enter.
Government regulation can also act as a barrier to entry. For example, a 
potential entrant to television broadcasting is deterred by government alloca-
tion of regular broadcast channels. A response to this limitation is for the new 
entrant to choose another means such as cable as the distribution channel—for 
example, the Fox Channel.
Two kinds of economic markets exist: substitutable and nonsubstitutable. 
Substitutable products are commodities such as groceries, cola drinks, and gaso-
line. In a nonsubstitutable market such as semiconductor manufacturing equip-
ment, the required associated infrastructure means that once purchasers choose a 
system, they are not inclined to switch due to high switching costs.
Switching costs are the costs to the customer to switch from the product of 
an incumbent company to the product of the new entrant. When these costs are 
high, customers can be locked into the product of the incumbents even if new 
entrants offer a better product. An example is the cost of switching from Micro-
soft to the Apple computer operating system. Users would need to purchase a 
new set of software to use on the Apple computer as well as train their employ-
ees to use the new software.

4.6   Achieving a Sustainable Competitive Advantage 79
Low Barriers to Entry in Web 2.0
Web 2.0 start-ups have been attractive to some entrepreneurs because the 
market seems relatively easy to enter. To them, it is a growth industry 
with low barriers to entry. The cost to set up a website is relatively low. 
Creating a website requires technical and programming knowledge, but 
modest capital investment. This industry offers an opportunity for entre-
preneurs with little financial backing to create a product for a huge mar-
ket quickly. Website services can easily be made accessible worldwide, 
without the need for physical distribution channels.
Ultimately, a firm strives to maintain a competitive advantage - those distinctive 
factors that give it a superior or favorable position in relation to its competitors. 
Competitive advantage brings together the firm’s core competencies and its stra-
tegic relationship within its industry.
As shown in Figure 4.5, a firm uses its distinctive competencies to man-
age its innovation, efficiency, product quality, customer relations, and supplier 
relations in order to differentiate its product and manage its costs. A technology 
venture works to design and produce at low cost the highest-quality product that 
possesses unique differentiating factors. Four common ways in which a firm will 
distinguish itself from its competitors are niche, cost, differentiation, and com-
bined differentiation and cost, as summarized in Table 4.6.
The niche strategy is directed toward one or two smaller segments of a larger 
market. This niche can be geographic or a product or price segment. The low-cost 
strategy is based on unique competencies that enable the efficient management 
of processes. The goal of a differentiation strategy is to create a unique product 
based on a firm’s unique competencies. Many firms can achieve a combined 
 differentiation–low-cost strategy that blends the best of low cost and differentiation.

CHAPTER 4   Competitive Strategy80
Niche ventures often require less capital and achieve financial success 
rather quickly. Typically, a niche business is too small for the mass-market 
supplier, and thus, competition is low. A niche can be geographic or a prod-
uct or price segment. Niche businesses typically are started in one market seg-
ment and based on a focused core competency and good customer and supplier 
 relationships.
Fastenal Company of Winona, Minnesota, is the largest distributor of nuts 
and bolts in the United States. It uses a low-cost strategy for its manufactur-
ing and distribution business with about 2,200 warehouse stores achieving total 
sales exceeding $2 billion. Each store has at least one delivery truck. Custom-
ers talk to the local store and receive personal service. Fastenal sees itself as an 
inventory and delivery manager offering excellent customer service. It currently 
has a fleet of 4,100 pickup trucks that respond to customer orders on an expe-
dited basis (www.fastenal.com).
Intel’s Competitive Advantage
Since the founding of Intel, its strategy was focused on technology leader-
ship, first-mover advantage, and the dominance of important new markets. 
Intel emerged as the dominant supplier of microprocessors, which are used 
in 90 percent of personal computers. Intel is also a leading manufacturer 
of flash memory, embedded control chips, and communication chips. A 
unique competency is Intel’s ability to build, manage, and exploit the 
world’s best semiconductor manufacturing facilities. As an example of its 
technology leadership strategy, Intel announced a new material that will 
replace silicon, enabling Intel to build more density (transistors per area) 
while reducing heating and current leakage. For decades, Intel has had a 
successful differentiation strategy.

Southwest Airlines is an example of an airline that started as a low-cost, 
niche low-cost business operating only in Texas. It served three cities—Dallas, 
Houston, and El Paso—and operated using standardized Boeing 737 aircraft. It 
used highly productive crews, frequent, reliable departures, and a no-frills (low-
cost), short-haul, point-to-point system. Eventually, Southwest moved to other 
western states and many locations across the nation. Thus, its strategy evolved to 
a differentiation-cost strategy.
Many profitable firms are built on differentiation: offering customers some-
thing they value that competitors don’t have. This unique offering can be in the 
product, service, or sales, delivery, or installation of the product. While the basic 
product may be a commodity, the differentiation can be obtained somewhere in 
the various interactions or services for the customer. Some firms selling personal 
computers attempt to differentiate themselves by offering high-quality service. 
Harley-Davidson differentiates itself from other motorcycle manufacturers, in 
part, by lending money to people to buy its motorcycles.
Miox is a New Mexico-based venture that produces water purification sys-
tems. Traditionally, these systems used volatile and hazardous chlorine gas. 
Miox developed a technology that allows their products to function using only 
salt and water (www.miox.com).
Paychex is an example of a company with a differentiation-cost strategy. It 
provides payroll-processing services and began by targeting small- and medium-
sized businesses that needed this service. The company offers customer service 
and payroll accuracy at a reasonable price, leading to wide acceptance. Once it 
has a satisfied customer, the switching costs for this customer are sizable. Pay-
chex’s revenues have grown to over $2 billion, and it serves more than 572,000 
businesses. Paychex’s annual revenue growth rate has been greater than 18 per-
cent for over 20 years.
With good hardware and friendly software, Apple’s portable devices made a 
profitable business out of digital music and applications—a business that eluded 
Sony, Microsoft, and Napster. What was the strategy that Apple adopted that led 
to success? The iPod was introduced in 2001, but it was the iTunes online-music 
store, introduced in 2003, that caused the iPod to take off. Apple sold more than 
35 million iPods in 2012. Furthermore, iTunes sold 400 million songs in the first 
year and 16 billion songs through 2011. Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007 
and the App Store in 2008. With rapid growth in the number of applications, 
Apple was able to differentiate itself in the phone market. Following the success 
of the iPod and iPhone, Apple then made another strong move with the introduc-
tion of the iPad in 2010. The iPod, iPhone, and iPad are easy-to-use, readily por-
table, and able to synchronize automatically with other Apple products including 
iTunes and iCloud. Apple used the differentiation-cost strategy of Table 4.6 to 
achieve rapid success.
IKEA provides furniture to customers who are young, not wealthy, likely to 
have children, and work for a living. These customers are willing to forgo ser-
vice to obtain low-cost furniture. IKEA designs its own low-cost, modular, and

ready-to-assemble furniture. In large stores, it displays a wide range of products. 
While IKEA is a low-cost provider, it also offers several differentiated factors, 
such as extended hours and in-store childcare. Its competitive advantage is based 
upon a  differentiation-cost strategy.
A competitive advantage is a significant difference in a product or service 
that meets a customer’s key buying criteria. Thus, competitive advantage can 
be based on lower costs or differentiation of product or both. Most firms try 
to improve the efficiency of their operations to lower costs. They also strive to 
innovate or provide superior quality to outdo their competitors.
All firms seek to erode competitors’ advantages by acting to imitate their 
product or service attributes or innovation. A sustainable competitive advantage 
is a competitive advantage that can be maintained over a period of time—hope-
fully, measured in years. The duration, D, of a competitive advantage, CA, leads 
to the estimate of the market value, MV, of a firm as
 MV 5 CA * D (3.1)  
That is, the market value of the firm is proportional to the size or magnitude 
of the competitive advantage and dependent on the expected duration of that 
advantage. A pharmaceutical firm with a 20-year patent and a strong competi-
tive advantage will be highly valued indeed!
The sustainability or duration of a firm’s competitive advantage, D, is a 
function of the competitors’ difficulty in imitating or innovating around the 
incumbent’s unique product or service attributes. This difficulty is present when 
unique skills and assets are required and are hard for a competitor to replicate or 
obtain. A firm such as General Electric is said to have a sustainable competitive 
advantage in the electric power industry. It has higher profit margins than all its 
competitors in this field.

4.6   Achieving a Sustainable Competitive Advantage 83
The pyramid of value creation is in Figure 4.6. From a solid base of assets, 
a firm builds its capabilities, which lead to its core competencies. With its core 
competencies and knowledge, it develops new products, processes, and other 
activities to build a competitive advantage. The sustainability of a firm’s com-
petitive advantage depends on its ability to continually innovate. Ultimately, the 
winning companies in the long term will be those that excel at learning how to 
do new things – not those who learn only how to improve existing practices 
[Reeves and Deimler, 2011].
In 1876, Sir Joseph Lister, a longtime advocate of improving sanitation con-
ditions, was invited to speak at a medical conference in Philadelphia. In atten-
dance was Robert Wood Johnson, who became inspired by Lister’s speech. In 
1886, Johnson, joined by two of his brothers, started Johnson and Johnson in 
order to manufacture a line of sterile surgical dressings. After experiencing some 
success, the company diversified into other segments of the medical industry. 
The company now manufactures pharmaceuticals and medical devices for phy-
sicians and consumers alike. Their products, including Tylenol, Band-Aids, and 
Listerine, are well known and trusted in the United States. The core competency 
of Johnson and Johnson is the ability to select and market trusted, useful prod-
ucts. Its consistency in doing so has allowed the company to retain a sustainable 
competitive advantage over the last century.

CHAPTER 4   Competitive Strategy84
4.7 Alliances
Many businesses use competitive strategies to shape their business strategies but 
often ignore cooperative strategies. Business is a complex mix of both competi-
tion and cooperation – sometimes called “coopetition.” A new venture possesses 
valuable novelty and innovation that will attract the attention of suppliers, cus-
tomers, competitors, and complementors, acting as a value network, as shown 
in Figure 4.7. All the participants are connected and participate in this network 
of activity. Consider the value network for a university, shown in Figure 4.8 
 [Brandenburger and Nalebuff, 1997]. The complementors to a university include 
kindergarten through grade-12 schools, local housing, community activities, 
and computing systems. All the members of the value network are connected 
together in the higher education value network. The university, to succeed, must 
cooperate with its suppliers, customers, competitors, and complementors. Com-
petitors can be seen as rivals but also will be, in many instances, collaborators.
Many technology ventures offer products or services that require distinc-
tive strategies because the products are parts of systems with complements pro-
vided by others. If a platform leader emerges and works with complementors, an 
ecosystem of innovation is formed [Gawer and Cusumano, 2008]. A platform 
strategy requires a compelling vision and strong leadership. A platform product 
or technology should provide a core function and be easy to connect for comple-
mentors. Examples of platform leaders are Google and Microsoft.
The value network is important to entrepreneurial ventures as they strive 
to accumulate the resources and capabilities required for success. The value of 
exploiting complementary resources can be significant [Hitt et al., 2001]. For 
example, a smaller, new biotechnology firm and a large pharmaceutical firm

can both benefit from an alliance. The biotech firm provides new technolo-
gies and innovation, while the pharmaceutical firm provides the distribution 
 networks and marketing capabilities to successfully commercialize the new 
products. The larger established pharmaceutical firm also gains value through 
access to its partner’s innovation. Thus, firms usually search for partners with 
complementary assets or capabilities. This is a partnership that enhances the 
value of each participant.
Few start-up firms will have all the necessary capabilities and resources. 
Alliance networks can enable them to move forward effectively. A partnership 
or alliance is an association of two or more firms that agree to cooperate with 
one another to achieve mutually compatible goals that would be difficult for 
each to accomplish alone [Spekman and Isabella, 2000]. Proactive firms take the 
initiative rather than react to events. Proactive formation of strategic alliances 
is an important dimension of entrepreneurial activity that enables a new firm to 
acquire access to unowned but required strategic assets. All alliances are based 
on some exchange of knowledge in addition to a flow of products, capital, or 
technology. Alliances function best when mutual  benefits and commitment are 
clear to all parties [Lee et al., 2005].

CHAPTER 4   Competitive Strategy86
The benefits of alliances can be significant. Both firms learn and acquire 
new capabilities. Furthermore, they have access to complementary resources that 
they cannot easily duplicate. Thus, a firm’s decision to enter an alliance can 
be motivated by a desire to exploit an existing capability or technology, or to 
explore for new opportunities and new technologies [Rothaermel and Deeds, 
2004]. For example, firms with diverse alliance partners increase their ability to 
innovate [Phelps, 2010].
To select an alliance partner, a firm must be clear which missing capabili-
ties or resources are required. Then, it must determine which firms possess those 
assets and look at their characteristics. For example, the alliance that Alibaba.
com and Yahoo! made in 2005 allows Yahoo! access to the Chinese market 
while Alibaba gains significant capital and expertise in scaling from Yahoo!. 
Startups with little track record may need to rely on the existing connections of 
their founders to establish these alliances [Hallen and Eisenhardt, 2012].
Entrepreneurs are well advised to visualize their alliance portfolios in the 
context of an entire industry, rather than as a series of single relationships. High- 
performing alliance portfolios emerge when entrepreneurs simultaneously form ties 
with multiple partners [Ozcan and Eisenhardt, 2009]. At the same time, alliances 
also place significant demands on an organization’s management capability. In fact, 
too many alliances can actually harm an organization’s performance. Thus, it is 
critical to examine each potential alliance for both the benefits it brings and the 
time, resources, and attention it will require [Rothaermel and Deeds, 2006].
Cell Phones and Gaming
As mobile phones became more and more popular, a significant opportu-
nity arose for the development of software for these devices. In particular, 
significant potential was seen for sales of games for mobile phones. Jam-
dat developed a number of these games, including the popular Bejeweled. 
In order to distribute these games, it had to form an alliance with mobile 
phone service providers like Verizon Wireless and Cingular (now AT&T). 
The service providers controlled the only distribution channel for these 
games. Because of the partnerships it was able to establish, the company 
also served as a link between other game developers and service provid-
ers. Acting as a gaming publisher in this way is now one of the company’s 
main functions. Jamdat was purchased by Electronic Arts in 2006 and is 
now called EA Mobile.
Keep in mind that complementor firms may also be potential competitors. 
Many a well-conceived alliance has fallen apart due to the tension between coop-
erative and competitive forces. Such tensions can arise from culture clashes, poor 
conflict management, and lack of effective coordination mechanisms. Furthermore, 
the entrepreneurial firm may be seeking access to needed assets but may, as a result, 
be exposed to the risk of losing its own vital internal knowledge. An example of this 
occurred during the development of the Apple Macintosh. Apple partnered with

2. Peg metrics to alliance progress, not just progress toward alliance goals
3. Leverage differences, rather than trying to eliminate them
4. Encourage collaboration by moving beyond formal structures
5. Manage internal stakeholders to ensure that all involved players are committed to the 
success of the alliance

Microsoft to develop spreadsheet, database, and graphical applications for the Mac. 
As a result, Microsoft acquired critical knowledge about Apple’s graphical user 
interface products, which eventually enabled its engineers to develop the Windows 
operating system [Norman, 2001]. At the same time, knowledge sharing is impor-
tant to maximize the success of a partnership. For example, when Starbucks places 
its coffee shops in Safeway stores, it makes sure that the Safeway employees at its 
counters are well-versed in the Starbucks way of doing things, so that the Starbucks 
brand and experience are maintained.
The type of alliance can range from a joint short-term project to a merger, as 
shown in Figure 4.9.
One approach to successful collaboration is to rotate leadership roles over the 
course of a project. Alliances continually dominated by a single organization or by 
the need to have consensus around every decision, by contrast, are associated with 
less innovation [Davis and Eisenhardt, 2011]. Table 4.8 outlines five other, simple 
rules for effectively managing alliances [Hughes and Weiss, 2007].

CHAPTER 4   Competitive Strategy88
A company can be said to be successful if it outperforms its competitors over time. 
Another view of how to formulate the best strategy for a venture is to match the 
firm’s approach to the pace of the market. Table 4.9 summarizes three  competitive 
approaches [Eisenhardt and Sull, 2001]. The first approach is based on establish-
ing a position in an industry and defending it. The goal is to  position the company 
so that its capabilities provide the best defense against the competitive forces of 
Figure 4.3 [Porter, 1998]. Furthermore, the positioning approach can be defended 
by anticipating shifts in the six forces of Figure 4.3 and responding to them.
The second method focuses on resources, such as patents and brand, and 
attempts to leverage those resources against the resources of the competitors. 
For example, the powerful brand of Southwest Airlines has enabled the firm to 
issue its own Visa card to many of its customers.
The third approach may be called emergent and is based on flexible and sim-
ple rules [Eisenhardt and Sull, 2001]. Firms using this method to develop a strat-
egy select a few significant strategic processes and build simple rules to guide 
them through the ever-changing marketplace. The strategic processes could be 
innovation, alliances, or customer relationships. Apple for example, has cho-
sen its user interface design, customer relationships and customized proprietary 
products as its basic strategy.  It then adjusts this strategy as conditions require.
Cisco Systems used an innovation strategy to guide it through emergent 
opportunities for its first years of operation. Later, it changed to a basic strategy 
of acquisitions to respond to rapidly changing markets. These basic tenets for 
guidance in emerging markets may be called simple rules and are summarized in 
Table 4.10 [Eisenhardt and Sull, 2001]. These rules allow a firm to compete in

a fast-moving marketplace such as the emergent markets that many technology 
ventures start in.
A good way to understand strategic planning in emerging industries is to imag-
ine an American football team trailing by a touchdown with only two minutes left 
to play, and it has the ball. The team refuses to panic. It has well-established rules 
of play for this situation. It switches to the “no-huddle” offense, with the quarter-
back calling the plays at the line of scrimmage as he surveys the defense.
Uncertainty is endemic in strategy formulation. Thus, the quality of a strategy 
cannot be fully assessed until it is tried. Strategy making can be thought of as an 
organizational capability, where different approaches are generated and considered, 
and where past successful approaches are just options for the future among many.
Sam Walton started with a strategy based on low-cost retail discount stores. 
He gained differentiation by locating many of these stores in relatively rural cit-
ies that were only large enough to support one large discount retail operation. His 
second differentiating factor was his organizational culture, which inspired his 
employees. As competition emerged, he developed one of the most cost- efficient 
distribution networks based on information technology systems. Walton’s simple 
rules of strategy and operation were part of Wal-Mart’s success.
In addition to matching the approach to the pace of the market, Table 4.11 
 highlights two key factors for determining a successful strategy: (1) specific 
 industry-related competence, and (2) the existing level of competitive rivalry in the 
industry [Shepherd et al., 2000]. The venture capitalists who participated in Shep-
herd’s study stated in summary: The most attractive strategy is led by a team that 
has strong competence in an industry that has not yet built up intense rivalries. The 
timing of entry may be favorable in these  circumstances.
The success of a new venture arises, in part, from a fit between the  distinctive 
competencies of the venture team and the major success factor requirements of 
the industry. The better the fit, the greater is the competitive advantage. A com-
petitive advantage is sustainable if the competencies of the venture quickly track 
and match the changing requirements of the industry. In addition, it is important 
to build alliances with critical stakeholders, such as suppliers or distributors, 
thus erecting barriers to new entrants.

CHAPTER 4   Competitive Strategy90
Every business strategy is unique since it is a unique mix of resources, 
context, goals, competencies, and organizational values. The potential for 
 differentiation of a firm’s strategy can also occur along a selected part of the 
consumption sequence shown in Figure 4.10 [McGrath et al., 2001]. Unique 
methods, tools, or arrangements can be used at each step in the sequence. Every 
new technology venture should look at the consumption sequence and decide 
where it can differentiate its product or service.
The power of computer maker Dell is its direct sales model offered to three 
different customer segments. The Dell direct sales model incorporates all 15 
steps of the consumption sequence. On the other hand, CDW (www.cdw.com) 
acts as a middleman reseller for Hewlett-Packard and offers excellent customer 
service for the purchaser who needs help in choosing a  computer. Its large 
sales force helps customers choose a total system that fits them, and a single 
salesperson is assigned to each customer for  follow-up and later purchases. 
The CDW sales model incorporates steps 3 through 10 of the consumption 
sequence.

4.9   The Socially Responsible Firm 91
Any strategy adopted by a new venture firm inevitably affects the welfare of its 
stakeholders: customers, suppliers, stockholders, and the community. While a 
specific strategy may enhance the welfare of some stakeholders, it may harm 
others. The leaders of new ventures are challenged to build a strategy that 
attempts to meet the economic and social needs of stakeholders while protecting 
the social and environmental needs of its region. An explicit statement of a new 
firm’s  strategy for acting responsibly and ethically may be an appropriate part of 
a business plan [McCoy, 2007].
The quality of life on our planet depends on three factors, as illustrated in 
Figure 4.11. The quality of life in a society depends on equity of liberty, oppor-
tunity, and health, and the maintenance of community and households, which 
can be called social capital, or social assets. The growth of the economy and the 
standard of living are critical needs for all people; we call this economic capital, 
or economic assets. Finally, the environmental quality of a region or the world 
can be called natural capital. The interrelationship between these three factors 
adds up to the total quality of life. Quality of life includes such basic necessities

as clothing, shelter, food, water, and safe sewage disposal. Beyond that, quality 
of life includes access to opportunity, liberty, and reasonable material and cul-
tural well-being [Dorf, 2001].
Business, government, and environmental leaders need to build up 
 capabilities for measuring and integrating these three factors and using 
them for decision making. We define the sum of these factors as the triple 
bottom line.
As they strive to treat nature and society respectfully while enhancing peo-
ple’s quality of life, corporations need to use nature only for what is necessary 
and in balance with what can be recycled and replenished.
Recognizing the interconnectedness and interdependence of all living 
things, corporate leaders can seek a balance using the triple bottom line concept. 
Economics, ecology, and society can be portrayed as a whole that depends on 
the person, the corporation, cultural values, and the community. Decisions made 
by corporations or society need to account for all the three factors of the triple 
bottom line.
For many people, there is a presumption that a company exists to enhance the 
 wel fare of society at large. For others, the only goal is the maximization of profits. 
We assert that the public welfare can be in the best interest of the corporation itself 
[Wang and Bansal, 2012]. One of the purposes of a firm is to make a profit—but 
service of society is also an implied expectation. In many ways, socially respon-
sible behavior—remembering its obligations to its employees, its communities, 
and the environ ment, even as it pursues profits for shareholders—is in a firm’s 
self-interest. A growing number of companies make corporate responsibility part 
of their value proposition. For example, Henry Ford believed he should pay his 
workers enough to afford to buy the cars they produced. His decision ultimately 
benefited Ford Motor Company by making it an attractive employer and stimu-
lating demand for its products. Moreover, social responsibility can serve as an 
important differentiator for a firm [Russo, 2010].
Some of the best companies in history have tended to pursue a mixture of 
objectives, of which making money is just one—and not necessarily the primary 
one. For Merck, a top priority is patient welfare. For Boeing, it is advancement 
of aviation technology. Profitability is a necessary condition for existence, but it 
is not the end in itself for many visionary companies. Consider Johnson & John-
son, whose credo, published in the early 1940s, was the basis for its response to 
the 1982 Tylenol crisis, when a cyanide tampering incident caused the deaths 
of seven people in the Chicago area. The company quickly removed all Tylenol 
capsules from the entire U.S. market at a cost of $100 million, though the deaths 
occurred only in Chicago.
The social virtue matrix of Figure 4.12 illustrates the four possible 
responses to social responsibility challenges. The response of the lower-left 
quadrant (box 3) is conduct that corporations engage in by choice, in accordance 
with norms and customs. The lower-right quadrant (box 4) represents compli-
ance—responsible conduct mandated by law or regulation [Martin, 2002]. 
These two  lower quadrants represent the basic commitment of companies to

society’s values and laws. Actions in the two lower quadrants (boxes 3 and 4) of 
Figure 4.12 generate little credit since the public expects actions to be in compli-
ance with its laws and norms. The most significant impediment to the growth of 
corporate virtue is limited vision for actions beyond compliance and allegiance 
to society’s norms.
The two upper quadrants encompass activities that have high social virtue. 
The strategic benefits quadrant (box 1) includes activities that may add to share-
holder value by generating positive reactions from customers, employees, or 
legal authorities. These actions may ultimately benefit the firm by accruing cus-
tomer goodwill and community support [Russo, 2010]. The upper-right quadrant 
(box 2) encompasses activities that clearly benefit society or the environment, 
but at a cost to the corporation. 
An example of a firm active in the upper-left quadrant (box 1) is Patagonia, 
founded by Yvon Chouinard in 1979 as a designer, marketer, and distributor of 
high-performance outdoor wear with a commitment to protect the natural envi-
ronment. The firm sought the use of low-impact fibers and drifted to organic 
cotton by 2000. Patagonia considered three criteria during the design and 
development of a project: its quality, its impact on the environment, and its

Solazyme Producing Fuel From Microalgae
Solazyme is a start-up that combined a profit mission with a social mission. 
Its founders, Jonathan Wolfson and Harrison Dillon, met while attending 
Emory University.  They set about trying to generate fuel from low-cost 
plant sugars.  The goal was to create a renewable source of energy from 
biomass sources, including waste products from sugar and corn crops. 
Today, Solazyme is a publicly held company that specializes in the pro-
duction of renewable oil for use in ground and air transportation, nutrition, 
and skin and personal care products.

aesthetics. In support of their commitment to sustainability of the environment, 
the firm featured a speaker series of prominent environmentalists. Furthermore, 
it often shared information with other clothing firms regarding the use of envi-
ronmentally favorable fabrics. 
One great opportunity to enter business in the top-left quadrant (by offering 
strategic corporate and social benefits) is to stimulate commerce at the bottom of 
the economic pyramid. For example, an entrepreneur can help the world’s poor 
by partnering with them to innovate new products and services that are valu-
able and profitable [Prahalad, 2005]. While individual incomes may be low, the 
aggregate buying power of poor communities is actually quite large, represent-
ing a substantial market in many countries. In these markets, entrepreneurs need 
to reconsider their focus on high gross margins and shift toward securing good 
returns on invested capital while delivering social and environmental benefits 
[Prahalad and Hammond, 2002].
Environmental challenges represent another opportunity to enter business in 
the top-left quadrant. Businesses that combat environmental degradation can be 
both profitable and socially beneficial [Dean and McMullen, 2007]. New tech-
nologies and business models can help build a sustainable world incorporating 
clean energy, drought-resistant crops, sound fish farming, biodiversity, and much 
more [York and Venkataraman, 2010]. Non-fossil fuel sources of energy such as 
wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, and biofuels will be developed over the next 
10 years as we shift to lower-impact fuel systems. New technology ventures will 
emerge as entrepreneurs find new means for big opportunities [Sachs, 2008].
Actions in the upper-right quadrant (box 2) may ultimately engender ben-
efit for shareholders. However, actions that provide benefits to society at a 
cost to a firm are difficult to defend to shareholders. For example, if only one 
automaker had decided to add air bags, it would lose some profits. When such 
an addition is mandated, all automakers can provide added social benefits at a 
competitive cost. Corporate coalitions, in which firms agree to provide benefits 
despite the costs, can also help firms take action in the upper-right quadrant.
The public wants information about a company’s record on social and envi-
ronmental responsibility to help decide which companies to buy from, invest in, 
and work for. As an example, see Starbucks website at http://www.starbucks.com/
responsibility. Starbucks estimates that it saved more than $40 million because 
the company’s socially responsible actions increased employee loyalty and 
reduced turnover. The Mexican cement company Cemex helps low-income

Good deeds can redound to a company’s credit. But, they can also backfire if the 
company fails to live up to the good-neighbor image it tries to project. Fifteen 
highly ranked, socially responsible companies are listed in Table 4.12.
4.10 Spotlight on Google
Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google in 1998 while they were gradu-
ate students at Stanford University. The company initially focused on Internet 
search, competing against Yahoo!, Excite, and other search services. Google 
built a competitive advantage through continual innovation. It exploited this dif-
ferentiation strategy (Table 4.6) over time as it added advertising technologies, 
software, mobile applications, and cloud computing. This array of innovation 
led to entry into many markets. 
Google offers many low-cost or free services, thus leveraging the “power of 
free.” It also has a well-developed infrastructure of bandwidth, servers, storage, and 
other hardware that powers its capabilities. Its business model, infrastructure, and 
continual innovation are difficult for competitors to match. Furthermore, Google 
leverages strategic alliances to expand and defend its business interests, as with the 
many partners who use and promote its Android operating system. In recognition 
of its commitment to the environment, education, and poverty alleviation, Google 
ranked number two in the Corporate Social Responsibility Index conducted by the 
Boston College Center for Corporate Citizenship and the Reputation Institute.
4.11 Summary
The strategy of a new business venture is its plan to act to achieve its goals. 
Given the challenge of an important problem (opportunity), the strategy pro-
vides a road map for the new firm to act to achieve a profitable solution to the 
problem. The strategy is designed to solve the problem by creating a unique 
and sustainable way of acting that, it is hoped, will lead to a profitable and 
valuable outcome for the customer and the firm. A solid strategy is based on:
 ■ Recognition of the firm’s core competencies.
 ■ Sound knowledge of the industry and the context for the venture.
 ■ A deep understanding of the firm’s strengths and weaknesses as well as its 
opportunities and threats.
 ■ A solid competitor analysis and review of the six forces encountered by 
firms in a rival market.
 ■ A strategic design that can lead to a sustainable competitive advantage.
 ■ A choice of a differentiation, low cost, differentiation and low cost, or 
niche strategy that provides unique value to the customer.
 ■ Formation of productive alliances with others and always acting in a 
socially responsible manner.

How can an entrepreneur build an effective 
strategy based on innovation that will lead to a 
sound technology venture?  
T
he decision to be the first mover needs to 
be addressed by all entrepreneurs. Using 
an idealized model of window of oppor-
tunity, the entrepreneur can decide when and 
how to act. The entrepreneur needs to maintain 
a sense of urgency but avoid being too early or 
too late to market. Entrepreneurs also seek to 
build an innovation strategy that involves new 
technologies, ideas, and creativity, which lead 
to invention and ultimately commercialization. 
Highly- successful new ventures may reshape 
entire industries through the creation of new prod-
ucts or services.

CHAPTER 5   Innovation Strategies100
Many entrepreneurs believe that the quick survive while the slow struggle. The 
firm that leads the way with a new product or into a new market expects to lock 
in a competitive advantage that ensures superior profits over the long run. In 
this section, we consider the circumstances in which a pioneer may benefit from 
being a first mover. A first-mover advantage is the gain that a firm attains 
when it is first to market a new product or enter a new market.
We will describe the industries that a new venture enters as mature, grow-
ing, or emergent, as noted in Table 5.1. Mature industries have slow rev-
enue growth, high stability, and intense competitiveness. Growing industries 
exhibit moderate revenue growth and have moderate stability and uncertainty. 
 Emergent industries are newly created or newly recreated industries formed by 
product, customer, or context changes [Barney, 2002]. New technology ventures 
often start in uncertain, emergent industries.
The pioneering, first-mover firm has to bear the costs of promoting and estab-
lishing a product, including the potentially high costs of educating customers and 
suppliers. Furthermore, due to the high uncertainty of emergent markets, it is sub-
ject to potential mistakes in product, strategy, and execution. The follower firm can 
learn from the pioneer’s mistakes and exploit the  market potential created by the 
pioneer. Some firms successfully exploit a follower strategy.
Early entrants (second or third movers) into an emergent industry can also 
benefit from the additional time to develop, commercialize, and exploit new 
products if they possess the resources to wait for the opportunity to materialize 
[Agarwal et al., 2002]. Many examples exist of new start-ups that arrived early 
but didn’t stay long. Pets.com, Helio, and Amp’d Mobile all burned through 
their investment capital before attracting enough customers to sustain a business. 
For most start-ups, the process is more like a marathon, where how fast you get 
out of the starting block is irrelevant.
In many cases, pioneer entrants tend to make a large and lasting impression 
on customers, obtaining strong brand recognition, and buyers often face high 
switching costs in moving their business to a later entrant. The simplest reason 
in favor of a first-mover strategy is the ease of recalling the first brand name

in a category. However, one study found that pioneers gained significant sales 
advantages but incurred large cost disadvantages relative to a fast follower 
entrant [Boulding and Christen, 2001]. The return on investment for pioneers 
was less than that for followers.
Of course, many conditions exist in which a first-mover advantage may be 
clear and compelling. Consider a mature industry such as restaurants or grocery 
stores. The attainment of a strategic resource such as a superior location may war-
rant acting as a first mover in a geographic market segment. Starbucks, for exam-
ple, wants a store on the busiest corner in a city and acts when it finds an available 
site. First movers with the right set of competencies and organizational practices 
can reap the returns from being in the right place at the right time.
If a market is insufficiently ordered or unstable, the first entry may be too 
early. A market is said to be stable if the requirements necessary for success will 
not change substantially during the period of industry development. Amazon.
com entered the online bookstore market and created intellectual property and the 
standard for this market. However, it incurred high development costs and had its 
advantages challenged by a later entry, BarnesandNoble.com. Nevertheless, Ama-
zon.com became the leader in the race by continuous innovation.
Pioneers are often said to gain a low-cost advantage from having a head 
start down the experience curve, which describes improvements in productivity 
as workers gain experience. Often these lower costs are an advantage over later 
entrants [Shepherd and Shanley, 1998]. New technology ventures often act as 
pioneers in a new or emerging industry to gain brand, cost, and switching cost 
advantages. The potential advantages and disadvantages of first-mover action 
are summarized in Table 5.2.
When both technological innovation and consumer acceptance advance rap-
idly, first movers may be left behind [Suarez and Lanzolla, 2005]. How ever, first 
movers may gain advantage in an evolving market if they involve customers and

product. If vision is wrong, then costs to 
switch are large

CHAPTER 5   Innovation Strategies102
suppliers in the innovation process [Langerak and Haltink, 2005]. New technol-
ogy ventures can exploit their nimbleness and competencies to build a competitive 
advantage. Amazon.com built a large business in a new market (e-commerce) in 
spite of the existence of large retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target.
Numerous examples exist of later entrants overtaking first movers and 
eventually bypassing them in profitability. Superior performance comes from 
distinctive competencies combined with an appropriate strategy leading to 
a competitive advantage (see Figure 4.5). Unfortunately, the first mover can 
develop a strategy based on uncertain or inaccurate assumptions about the six 
forces (see Figure 4.3). A follower who learns from the first mover’s mistakes 
can move quickly to catch up or pass the first mover. The first mover also  suffers 
from uncertainty about the customer, the organizational capabilities needed, and 
the industry context.
However, pioneering ventures can use their lead time to build relationships 
among suppliers, customers, and even competitors. These relationships can 
build trust and brand that a follower may not easily reproduce. A first-mover 
advantage can usually be attained under conditions of low market and internal 
firm uncertainty. Regrettably, most new ventures encounter large measures of 
uncertainty and must weigh carefully when to enter the market [Kessler and 
Bierly, 2002]. Entrepreneurs should emphasize speed to market in predictable 
markets. In an uncertain market, the new venture can probe or test the market by 
trying product tests, focus groups, and other means of market probes.
A commitment is an action taken in the present that binds an organization to 
a future course of action. A decision to act as a first mover is usually  binding and 
should not be taken lightly. Preemptive actions can deter potential rivals from 
entering but may also result in heavy, irreversible investments [Sull, 2005].
The entrepreneur considers entering a market during an estimated period of 
opportunity often called a window of opportunity. The first mover envisions a 
greater cash flow as a result of early entry, as shown in Figure 5.1. Uncertainty 
about the period of opportunity can erode the actual results. If the first mover mises-
timates the timing of the window, a less attractive cash flow curve will result.
An entrepreneur’s objective is to decide when to stop searching for  additional 
information and enter the new market so as to maximize the expected profit. With 
insufficient information, a firm can enter too early and incur a large cost. How-
ever, if it takes too long to gather sufficient information, the firm may lose the 
first-mover advantage. Entrepreneurs should stop searching for information and 
enter a market when they estimate that the  marginal benefit of additional knowl-
edge is less than the payoff of entry [Lévesque et al., 2009].
Being a first mover means recognizing what direction existing technologies 
and industries are heading before competitors do. Today most personal com-
puters (PCs) are built to support intense multimedia applications. In the early 
1980s, most people did not recognize the role that gaming would play in the 
development of the PC. Chong-Moon Lee founded Diamond Multimedia Sys-
tems  in 1982 to supply PC products such as color graphic and acceleration add-
on boards. They significantly enhanced consumers’ ability to play high-quality

games on their computers. Eventually, Diamond’s first-mover strategy and supe-
rior products captured the attention of IBM and Tandy (then the number 1 and 
number 2 PC makers in the world, respectively). As these companies increased 
the standard multimedia features on their PCs, they continued to buy Diamond 
products to provide a better customer experience. In 1995, Diamond went pub-
lic and raised $126 million by selling 30 percent of the company. Lee had suc-
cessfully identified the direction that personal computing would be going. His 
 first-mover  position and perseverance over time allowed him to leave a lasting 
impression on both the computer and gaming markets.
History is replete with companies that were first movers that did not succeed. 
The CPM operating system preceded Apple, which preceded DOS, which eventu-
ally became the early dominant operating system for the PC. Safety razors were 
introduced a decade before Gillette introduced its successful safety razor. The prod-
uct must have the right mix of attributes and features, and must be understood as 
well as demanded by the customer. Early movers don’t always have all the requi-
site characteristics. Prodigy was the first commercial e-mail system, but it received 
poor acceptance. The second entrant, CompuServe, was equally unsuccessful. Only 
later did AOL and MSN put together the right mix of attributes to succeed.

FIGURE 5.2 The sense-of-urgency cycle that can be 
experienced by new enterprises.
Many new ventures set a fast pace as they and their competitors enter a 
window of opportunity. Many start-ups exhibit a torrid pace due to a high sense 
of urgency, as illustrated by the causal diagram in Figure 5.2. A causal diagram 
can help protray causal links in a system. Variables are related by causal links, 
shown by arrows. For example, the link denoted with an * implies that if “sense 
of urgency” increases, then “decision speed” increases. As the firm experiences 
a sense of urgency due to a shortfall of customers, it acts to build capacity to 
design, build, and sell its products. However, inevitable delays, D, slow down 
the buildup of capacity. As capacity increases, the firm expects customers to 
buy, but again it may experience delay as customers consider the purchase care-
fully. A slowdown in the growth of customer buildup results in a sales shortfall 
and an increasing sense of urgency [Perlow et al., 2002]. One way to decrease 
this unfortunate urgency cycle is to reduce the delay in capacity building and the 
time delay to customer purchase.
An encouraging case of good timing and entry into a marketplace is that of 
Google. Google entered the Internet search engine market in 1998, well after 
other search engines were firmly established. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the 
founders of Google, met in 1995 as Ph.D. candidates at Stanford University. 
Over the next 18 months they collaborated to build a new search engine that

Web page. The vision of the firm was “to organize the world’s information.” 
They allowed limited, less-intrusive advertising on the their site.
During late 1998, they wrote a business plan and raised $1 million in fund-
ing from family, friends, and angel investors. Working out of a garage in 1998, 
Google was answering 10,000 queries a day. In late 1999, it was answering three 
million queries each day. Google received $25 million in venture capital funding. 
In August 2004, Google sold about 20 million shares in an initial public offer-
ing at $85 per share. By 2009, the company had a market capitalization of $150 
billion. Google’s competitive advantages include its search technologies and its 
technical competencies. There is always a place for a new entry in a rapidly grow-
ing marketplace with a great technological innovation.
An example of identifying a window of opportunity both in a geographic 
market and for a technology is the founding of Baidu by Robin Li and Eric Xu. 
After spending several years working in the search industry, Li recognized that 
there was a need for a Chinese language Internet search engine in China. After 
Baidu was founded in 1999, the next four years were spent developing the best 
technology for China. With over a billion Chinese citizens, Li recognized that 
it was important to develop a search technology that would best serve everyone 
in China. In 2004, once Li felt Baidu had created the best search engine for the 
Chinese market, the firm shifted its focus to increasing brand awareness in China. 
2005 saw an increased focus on revenue generation. Baidu’s commitment to both 
search technology and the Chinese market helped it to become the second largest 
independent search engine in the world.
Machiavelli wrote in The Prince (XVII): “The prince ought to be slow to 
believe and to act, nor should he himself show fear, but proceed in a temperate 
manner with prudence and humanity, so that too much confidence may not make 
him incautious.” An entrepreneur will be temperate and patient to move. On the 
other hand, an entrepreneur has a propensity to act. If a window of opportunity 
appears to be in the distant future, the entrepreneur may be wise to abandon the 
distant opportunity and seek one that is available and active now. If a window is 
about to “open,” action may be prudent.
Silicon Valley Bank (SVB): Founding at Optimal Time
In the early 1980s, the deregulation of the banking industry led to a need 
for new innovative banks. In the same period, the Bank of America, which 
served the San Francisco area, was discontinuing its lending to high-tech 
companies. At that time, one of the founders of SVB had a series of meet-
ings with bankers who were interested in participating in this opportunity. 
These factors converged, and the lead founder acted on his intuition, all of 
which led to the formation of Silicon Valley Bank in 1983 (see www.svb.
com). Since its founding, SVB has played an important role in the early 
days of such successful ventures as Cisco Systems, Electronic Arts, Intuit, 
JDS Uniphase, KLA Tencor, and Veritas. The launch of Silicon Valley 
Bank is a sound example of good timing.

CHAPTER 5   Innovation Strategies106
5.2 Imitation
Imitation is said to be the greatest form of flattery. Many important new  ventures 
have been based on the replication or modification of an existing  business that 
the entrepreneur encounters through previous employment or by chance [Bhidé, 
2000]. Entrepreneurs start an imitating business because they believe they can 
manage the business as well or better than the example they are copying. Sam 
Walton opened his first Wal-Mart in Rogers, Arkansas, after making numerous 
trips to study discount retailers in other regions of the United States. Walton 
once said: “Most everything I’ve done, I’ve copied from someone else.” Tech-
nologists attend trade shows and  conferences and often notice competitors’ new 
products that their firm may readily produce.
Unfortunately, most attempts to replicate excellent businesses fail 
[ Szulanski and Winter, 2002]. The difficulty of imitation springs from the 
lack of deep understanding of the excellent business example. Furthermore, 
the  transfer of the best business practices from one setting to another can be 
fraught with unforeseen uncertainty. Imitation by independent entrepreneurs 
can be difficult because when they look at the existing business, they can-
not fully understand what makes it work. Thus, the best approach is to copy 
it in detail but  recognize that quick response to customer feedback will be 
necessary.
In 1986, Howard Schultz started his first independent effort as Il Giornale, 
a store modeled on his experience of Italian espresso bars. He played Italian 
opera in the Seattle store, and servers wore bowties. Il Giornale was set up as a 
stand-up bar, as is common in Italy, and it did not offer nonfat milk. Schultz had 
transferred the Italian coffee bar to Seattle with mixed success. People wanted 
chairs, and servers did not want ties. Nonfat milk quickly found its way onto the 
menu [Schultz, 1997].
Close copying may be the best method of imitation. It is important, how-
ever, to recognize the value of management and leadership, which is difficult 
to clone. A talented leader of an excellent business possesses some skills and 
capabilities that may be difficult to readily understand or copy.
Once the new business is up and running, customer comments can be used to 
adjust the business procedures to local conditions. Schultz loved the  experience 
of Italian coffee bars but eventually adjusted his coffee café to fit Seattle’s 
desires. Schultz was successful in adapting his Il Giornale store and ultimately 
created a successful system. He opened a second Seattle store after six months 
and a third store in Vancouver in 1987. By August 1987, Schultz arranged for 
his investor group to purchase all the Starbucks stores and its coffee roasting 
facility. He then merged his Il Giornale and Starbucks under the Starbucks name. 
By 2013,  Starbucks had over 20,000 stores worldwide and revenues of over 
$13 billion.
JetBlue Airways is a good imitation of Southwest Airlines. Based on a low-
cost, all-coach, point-to-point business model, JetBlue started in February 2000 
with two aircraft serving New York City and Fort Lauderdale, Florida. JetBlue’s

initial public offering in 2002 raised almost $150 million for expansion. JetBlue 
was an excellent example of sound imitation. 
5.3 Technology and Innovation Strategy
As discussed in Chapter 2, there are many different types of  innovation—
incremental, architectural, modular, and disruptive—and many sources of 
inventions, including existing companies, research labs and universities, 
and open technical communities. Most inventions, however, are never actu-
ally commercialized and never become true innovations. Whereas invention 
is the development of a product or process for the first time, innovation is 
the application of that product or process and its adoption by the market 
[Hall and Rosenberg, 2010]. Only about 6 percent of inventions developed 
by independent inventors actually reach a market [Astebro, 1998]. In estab-
lished firms, the success rate is about four times as high, which still means 
that three-quarters of these inventions are never commercialized. Given this 
low success rate, it is critical for entrepreneurs to have a sound innovation 
strategy.
It is often a long road from invention to commercialization. Chester Carl-
son developed the photocopier process—converting an image into a pattern of 
electrostatic charges that attract a powdered ink—in his kitchen. He patented 
the process in 1942. After years of little interest from established companies, 
he obtained help from the Battelle Institute. Then the Haloid Company pur-
chased a license in 1946. Haloid, which became Xerox, successfully demon-
strated a working product in 1949. In 1960, Haloid Xerox finally introduced 
the first successful office copier, the Xerox 914.
In 1968, John Chowning invented the FM synthesis technique for creat-
ing digital sounds. The first product to incorporate FM synthesis, a musical 
keyboard, was not released until 1982 and it wasn’t until the 1990s that the 
technique found application in mobile phone ring tones—three decades after 
its invention [Nelson, 2005].
Schumpeter asserted that the process by which independent entrepreneurs 
created inventions to produce new goods, services, raw materials, and organiz-
ing methods is central to understanding business organization, the process of 
technical change, and economic growth. An innovation strategy rests on the 
competencies and knowledge of the new firm. Continual product and process 
innovation can enable the firm to maintain a strategic advantage. Figure 5.3 
illustrates the innovation and competition cycle between firms. Competitors cre-
ate innovations and offer new value to customers, fueling demand and sales and 
increasing the innovator’s market share. The struggle is for each competitor to 
keep up in this innovation cycle.
While inventors can license or sell technological opportunities to others, the 
creation of new firms is an important mechanism through which entrepreneurs 
use technology to bring new products, processes, and ways of organizing into 
existence. Three factors influence the decision to exploit an independent invention

CHAPTER 5   Innovation Strategies108
through firm creation: the interests of the entrepreneurial team, the characteristics 
of the industry in which the invention would be exploited, and the characteristics 
of the invention itself. We have discussed the first two of these factors, especially, 
in Chapters 1 through 4. Of course, the entrepreneurial team must be interested 
in the opportunity to be solved by the invention, and it must be satisfied that the 
industry will welcome and support the commercialized invention. In this section, 
we will further consider the characteristics of the invention itself.
Three dimensions of technological inventions impact the probability that they 
will be commercialized through a new firm formation: importance, radicalness, and 
patent scope [Shane, 2001]. Importance reflects the magnitude of the economic 
value of an invention. The importance of an invention should increase the likeli-
hood that a new firm will be founded to commercialize it because more important 
inventions have higher economic value and thus payoff to the entrepreneurs. Many 
inventions have limited commercial value and thus are not attractive to the entre-
preneur. A critical determinant of an invention’s importance is whether or not it 
addresses a real need. For example, if an invention makes it easier to do something 
that customers were not trying to do in the first place, it will fail [Christensen, 2002]. 
Thus, a “build it and they will come” innovation strategy will most likely fail.
Radicalness measures the degree to which an invention, regardless of eco-
nomic value, differs from previous inventions in the field. Radical inventions 
have the potential, therefore, to be disruptive innovations. The radicalness of 
an invention is a reflection of the potential market effect of the commercial-
ized invention. Radical technologies destroy the capabilities of existing firms 
because they depend on new capabilities and resources. Finally, patent scope 
describes the breadth of intellectual property protection for the invention. These 
three dimensions of likelihood of commercialization are listed in Table 5.3.

5.3   Technology and Innovation Strategy 109
Dean Kamen, the holder of more than 440 patents, is one of the well-
known inventors of the past three decades. He invented devices for infant 
care, for insulin delivery to diabetics, and for replacing the wheelchair 
[Brown, 2002]. Kamen invented the Segway Human Transporter in 2001. It 
is an electric scooterlike device. Gyroscopes inside the base platform make 
the scooter highly stable and self-balancing. There is no brake handle, engine, 
throttle, or gearshift. Users lean forward to go forward and backward to 
reverse direction. The inventor says the Segway can traverse ice, snow, or 
even large rocks. Although the Segway is a radical invention and is covered 
by patents, its economic value remains a question and it has not enjoyed the 
widespread adoption that many people predicted.
We can portray the new business formation process for an invention as 
shown in Figure 5.4. Using this process to review the potential of the Segway 
Human Transporter, one can obtain different conclusions for the various pro-
posed uses: postal service, warehouse workers, or urban dwellers. Perhaps the 
best application for this device is not yet named.
The difficulty with deciding whether to proceed to commercialize an inven-
tion can depend, especially, on the radicalness of the invention. Disruptive or 
radical innovations introduce a set of attributes to a marketplace different from 
the ones that mainstream customers historically have valued, and the products 
often initially perform unfavorably along one or two dimensions of performance 
that are particularly important to those customers. As a result, mainstream 
customers are unwilling or unable to use disruptive products in applications 
they know and understand. At first, therefore, disruptive innovations tend to 
be used and valued only in new uncertain markets or applications.
Often the disruptive technology will not immediately serve a mainstream 
market, as shown in Figure 5.5. It will initially serve a niche market but will 
eventually enter the low end of the range of the mainstream market, as shown 
in Figure 5.5. For example, consider voice recognition software. The current 
performance of computer software for voice recognition is not always adequate 
for high-accuracy speaking (dictating) of documents for typing them; this might 
require 95 percent accuracy. Undoubtedly, there are many less-demanding 
uses for voice recognition software, such as voice-generated e-mails, customer

service by telephone, or Siri voice-control software on iPhones. Thus, this inno-
vation has entered the low end of the range of required performance and is pro-
gressing upward toward wider application.
Consider the disruptive innovation of U.S. discount stores in the 1960s. The 
increased mobility of shoppers enabled discount stores such as Kmart to select 
locations at the edge of town, reducing department stores’ competitive advantage 
of prime city-center locations. The discount store had a new innovative business 
model: low-cost, high-unit volume and turnover provided at convenient subur-
ban locations. It executed a trajectory from low-cost hard goods to low-cost hard 
and soft goods, and entered the mass markets in the 1970s and 1980s. Today, 
Target and Wal-Mart are in the center of the mass market. A recent disruptive 
challenge in the retail industry was Amazon.com, which appeared originally as 
an online bookstore but rapidly migrated toward becoming an online department 
store. Today, many people cite three-dimension (3D) printing as a disruptive

technology, predicting that it will move from highly specialized applications to 
the mainstream. For example, MakerBot Industries is one of the leading start-
ups in 3D printing. MakerBot has sold more than 6,000 printers to emerging 
technology teams within manufacturing companies and universities, and the 
start-up predicts rapidly growing sales. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has 
invested in the start-up. Disruptive innovations, therefore, begin by addressing 
niche markets. With the right resources and capabilities, a new firm can satisfy 
initial needs in these markets, leveraging this early success toward mainstream 
dominance.
5.4 New Technology Ventures
Often, an entrepreneur encounters a new technology, but a compelling applica-
tion of the technology is not obvious. Thus, a new technology sometimes can be 
characterized as a solution looking for a  problem. Neither the first companies 
to use the technology nor the companies with the best technology necessarily 
win. Instead, the firms that find the right application for the technology succeed 
[Balachandra  et al., 2004].
The elements of an attractive innovation strategy are provided in Table 5.4. 
Any new venture should have a defined customer, one or two key benefits, a short 
period to payback, and a proprietary advantage. Finally, the new venture team 
must possess the necessary core competencies to exploit the new technology.
One way of describing the potential applications is to use the model shown 
in Table 5.5. The new technology is described briefly, and the key assumptions

are listed. Then, the core competencies required for the venture are described. 
Finally, the possible applications market challenges are noted. Table 5.5 shows 
the summary of two fictional ventures. The Rotary Engine Inc. example illus-
trates an attractive new technology venture for vehicle engines, marine engines, 
appliances, and recreational vehicles. The market challenges are listed, and an 
attempt is made to fund the best application that will satisfy the required ele-
ments of an attractive innovation strategy. 
A second example of a new technology is Fuel Cell Inc. Fuel cell technolo-
gies have been of great interest over the past decade. However, an  economic 
application is not yet proven. With the lack of supporting infrastructure, fuel 
cells have limited automobile applications. On the other hand, fuel cells as 
energy storage devices serving as battery replacements may be viable soon.

Examples of new technologies that eventually found attractive economic 
applications include semiconductors, genomics, stents, lasers, and wireless tele-
phony. All these technologies eventually traversed the four steps necessary for a 
 favorable technology innovation, as shown in Figure 5.6.
Any new attractive technology has to be feasible and manufacturable, and 
provide valued performance. With a sound business model and strategy, the new 
technology venture strives to achieve profitability in a reasonably short period.
Perhaps the greatest challenge is to develop an innovation that replaces 
fossil fuels [Carr, 2008]. The challenge is to find a low-cost, high-energy 
renewable fuel. Examples include wind, geothermal, waves, biomass, and solar 
technologies. These innovations must be effective, consistent, sustainable, and 
low cost. Solving global warming and creating green technologies will chal-
lenge innovators to develop economic innovations that can be brought to mar-
ket and enable significant growth of use and scale [Krupp and Horn, 2008].

5.6   Summary 115
Technology entrepreneurs bring together the technical world and the 
 business world in a profitable way. Entrepreneurship is a fundamental driver 
of the technological innovation process [Burgelman et al., 2004]. In summary, 
technology entrepreneurship is about the creation of a new business enterprise 
that generates benefits (wealth, jobs, value, progress) for participating parties by 
creating unique, new arrangements of resources, including technology, to meet 
the needs of customers and society.
5.5 Spotlight on AgraQuest 
Pam Maronne and several other associates formed AgraQuest in Davis, Califor-
nia, in 1995. AgraQuest’s goal was to develop natural products for pest control 
that would enable farmers to avoid chemical pesticides. Maronne had already 
worked on natural, environmentally-friendly products and processes at Ento-
tech, which sold to Abbott Laboratories. 
Using a proprietary technology, AgraQuest’s scientists analyzed tens of 
thousands of naturally-occurring microorganisms that could protect plants 
against insects, nematodes, and plant pathogens. They then selected the 
most promising candidates for further development. AgraQuest’s innova-
tion strategy was based upon proprietary processes and patents. The patents 
cover the microbe and its use as well as novel natural product compounds and 
mixtures.
Bayer CropScience of Germany acquired AgraQuest for $425 million 
in 2012. Bayer will use AgraQuest’s innovations to build a technology plat-
form for green products that control a broad spectrum of pests and diseases. 
Bayer intends to offer farmers integrated pest management programs to 
minimize the development of pesticide-resistant crops and to maximize crop 
yields.
5.6 Summary
Successful innovative firms strive to time their entry into markets. They balance 
a sense of urgency with a deliberate buildup to action. Working with partners—
firms and individuals—most firms can enhance their capabilities and strengths 
for creativity, invention, and innovation. Almost all firms build an innovation 
strategy that strives to provide them with a sustainable action plan.
 ■ A first-mover strategy can lead to significant benefits in an emerging 
 market, but is not a guarantee of success.
 ■ An innovation strategy creates a road map for continual commercialized 
 invention.
 ■ An ambitious venture can strive to design a product or service that is a 
 disruptive application (“killer app.”) that reshapes an industry. bye23429_ch05_099-118.indd   115bye23429_ch05_099-118.indd   115 04/10/13   3:45 PM04/10/13   3:45 PM

Concept Development and 
 Venture Formation
T
he founders of a new venture should create a business plan. This plan 
should guide the team members as they think through opportunity identifi-
cation, market sizing, competitive threats, product strategy, sales and dis-
tribution strategy, required resources, and potential financial outcomes. A good 
business plan will be a valuable tool in attracting investors and in convincing 
others to join the new venture. The venture team then experiments using the plan 
to mitigate the associated risks while using innovation to increase the chances of 
success. If possible, a business design will achieve economies of scale and scope.
The management team also needs to engage in product design and development. 
The use of prototyping and iterative product development can result in the creation 
of outstanding products that most closely meet customer needs. Concurrent with 
product development and design, the team should create and test a marketing and 
sales strategy. The strategy should identify target customers, the messages that 
best position and differentiate the product, and the distribution strategy. Marketing 
programs include traditional marketing, new social media, and the use of market-
ing analytics. The sales plan needs to determine the right mix of direct versus 
indirect sales as well as the mix of inside sales versus face-to-face selling. 
The venture techniques described in this book can be used by entrepreneurs 
to build an independent business as well as a corporate venture emerging within 
an established firm. Large corporations can learn to confront the innovators’ 
dilemma and build a viable corporate venture.

How are ventures actually formed and what is 
the role of the business story and plan? 
E
ntrepreneurs respond to attractive oppor-
tunities by forming new ventures. In this 
chapter, we consider the five-step process 
for establishing a new enterprise. One particularly 
noteworthy step in the process is the development 
of a story and a business plan. The story is a com-
pelling synopsis of why this venture is needed at 
this moment of time and how it can achieve suc-
cess. We then detail the task of writing a business 
plan, which is a worthy effort to better prepare the 
venture for testing its assumptions and hypothesis 
with others.

CHAPTER 6   The Business Story and Plan122
Table 6.1 shows the five-step process for starting a new venture. The new ven-
ture will follow the steps to prepare a business plan that is suitable for the team 
as well as for the investors and business partners. This process is broad enough 
to apply to all types of businesses: independent or corporate, small or large, 
niche or broad, family or franchise, nonprofit, and one attempting a radical 
 versus incremental innovation.
The corporate venture will also prepare a business plan suitable for review 
by the parent corporation to secure the necessary resources and assistance from 
its parent. The five-step process of Table 6.1 can be used for corporate ventures 
where the investors of step 5 will normally be the parent firm. We defer until 
Chapter 10 the discussion of corporate ventures and the appropriate legal form a 
venture should adopt.
A talented leader of a new venture has a vision and a plan to implement it. 
He or she can motivate people and manage information and resources so that 
the business can create a profit. The performance of a new venture is a conse-
quence of factors that encompass the dimensions of a business as portrayed in 
Figure 6.1. The quality of the opportunity and its fit with the vision lead to the 
accumulation or creation of the distinctive competencies based on resources and 
capabilities. Following from a set of competencies, a business strategy is created 
based on novelty or innovation within an industry context. The attractiveness of 
the industry with respect to its business opportunities affects the profit potential 
and the expected return of the venture. Access to resources and the ability to 
attract the entrepreneurial team will depend on the attractiveness of the new ven-
ture. The industry environment will determine the amount of resources available 
to the venture since capital typically flows to industries in which opportunities 
are abundant and attractive.  Furthermore, the industry-related competencies of 
the entrepreneurial team, which refers to the level of experience and knowledge 
with the industry, will lead to the expectation of greater success.
TABLE 6.1 Five-step process for establishing a new venture.
1.   Identify and screen opportunities. Create a vision and concept statement, and build an 
initial core entrepreneurial team. Describe the initial ideas about the value proposition 
and the business model.
2.   Refine the concept, determine feasibility, and prepare a mission statement. Research the 
business idea and prepare a set of scenarios. Create a story and the outline of a business 
plan with an executive summary.
3.   Prepare a complete business plan including a financial plan and the legal organization 
suitable for the venture.
4.   Determine the amount of financial, physical, and human resources required. Prepare a 
financial model for the business and determine the necessary resources. Prepare a plan 
for acquiring these resources.
5.   Secure the necessary resources and capabilities from investors, as well as new talent and 
alliances.

6.2   The Concept Summary and Story 123
The identification and acquisition of required resources and capabilities are 
crucial for a firm’s success. For a fast-growing firm based on continuing innova-
tion, the intellectual resources are critical to success. The securing of the neces-
sary resources and capabilities may occur in stages, as required.
The creation of a business plan focuses on the stages of building a business, 
as portrayed in Figure 6.1. The initial formation of a suitable structure for the 
business follows the business strategy. The ability to remain competitive and 
innovative while operating through an appropriate structure can lead to enduring 
profitability.
The greatest risk in creating a business is the failure to complete all the steps 
of Table 6.1 and Figure 6.1. Some entrepreneurs who possess strong technical 
skills and capabilities unfortunately skip the formation of a business strategy 
that will lead to profitability. Another risk is that the business plan may have 
an inadequate plan for the organizational structure and the management of pro-
cesses and talent. Finally, remember the iterative and dynamic nature of this pro-
cess. As an opportunity and the appropriate response to it evolve, the business 
plan should change, too.
6.2 The Concept Summary and Story
The road to success starts with the concept summary and new venture story. 
Once an entrepreneur has decided to act upon a business opportunity, it is impor-
tant to prepare a concept summary of the new venture. This summary can be 
a simple statement of the problem being addressed and how the venture will 
solve it. Table 6.2 gives the elements of the concept summary. For example, the

CHAPTER 6   The Business Story and Plan124
business concept for Twitter might be summarized as “an online social network 
and microblogging service that enables its members to read and send short text 
messages.”
A story is a narrative of factual or imagined events. It depicts a course of 
challenge, plan, actions, and outcomes in a manner similar to a plan. A good 
story and business plan define an opportunity, a concept, cause and effect, and 
an outcome all held together in a holistic way. Stories use plot lines and twists 
to capture the imagination and interest of the listener. They tell the ultimate goal 
of the venture, the ideological challenge, and the means of achieving the goal. 
The creation of an appealing and coherent story may be a useful form of com-
munication for entrepreneurs in the attempt to attract interest and support for 
their idea and plan. To be effective, the content of the story must align with the 
interests and background of the listener. A well-crafted story about a new ven-
ture emphasizes the goals and merits of the venture. Telling a compelling story 
inspires belief in a venture’s motives, character, and capacity to reach its goals 
[Ibarra and Lineback, 2005].
Stories are an integral part of the process by which founders start and build 
new ventures, acquire needed resources, and generate new wealth [Lounsbury 
and Glynn, 2001]. Storytelling is applicable to corporate new ventures as well 
as independent new ventures. Stories play a critical role in the process of the 
emergence of a new business. Stories can lead to favorable interpretations of 
the social benefits and wealth-creating possibilities of the venture, thus enabling 
resources to flow to the new enterprise. Furthermore, they can legitimize new 
ventures, thus helping to build acceptance of them. A good entrepreneurial story 
attracts financial and human resources, and builds industry acceptance. It can 
help amass support for a new venture. Successful entrepreneurs must shape 
interpretations of the nature and potential of their new venture for those who 
may supply needed resources.
As the founder of both Netscape and Healtheon, Jim Clark provided the 
story for both companies. In the case of Healtheon, his story was personal. Jim 
Clark contracted an illness in late 1995 that gave him personal experience with 
the health-care industry, its bureaucracy, and resulting paperwork demands. 
He responded with a concept: The patient would have a password and a digital 
record, and the doctor would use the Internet for billing forms with no hassle 
for both parties. He drew a diagram of the four players in the health-care indus-
try, as shown in Figure 6.2. He then placed his new venture in the center of 
the diagram as the solution, via the Internet, for the entire industry. Clark told 
a story of critical importance to his nation, described the dramatic challenges 
TABLE 6.2 Elements of a concept summary.

6.2   The Concept Summary and Story 125
and opportunities, and then portrayed the solution: his new venture. With his 
compelling story, Clark went on to raise millions of dollars to build Healtheon, 
which later was sold to WebMD [Lewis, 2000].
In constructing a legitimate identity for a new venture, the storyteller must 
forge a careful balance between emphasis on existing challenges and the poten-
tial for distinctiveness. The investor may be drawn by the credibility of the story 
and the storyteller to seriously consider investment. 
New firms should not rely solely on a pure bullet-point presentation. A list 
of bullet points reduces a set of issues to a few points but provides little  fabric 
or motivation. Bulleted lists are often generic in meaning and leave challenges 
and relationships unspecified. Furthermore, they often leave critical assumptions 
unstated. A good story includes all the challenges, relationships, and assump-
tions in the very fabric of the narrative. A presentation can use some bullet-point 
slides but should emphasize the story it wants to tell.
The new venture story consists of three elements, as shown in Table 6.3 
[Shaw et al., 1998]. The first step is the setting of the stage by describing the 
current conditions of the industry, society, and the existing relationships and 
opportunities. The story should be about a person or group whose challenges the 
listener can relate to.
Next, the storyteller introduces the dramatic conflict by describing the 
 challenges confronting the venture, the need for a plan to overcome the challenges 
at this turning point, and the critical obstacles and issues. Finally, in the third step, 
the storyteller describes the plan to overcome the obstacles, secure the necessary 
resources, and move on to resolution and success [Ibarra and  Lineback, 2005].

CHAPTER 6   The Business Story and Plan126
BET: Selling a Story
In 1980, Robert Johnson created an innovative plan to produce television 
programs targeted to black viewers. Johnson met with several investors 
and told them his story of the opportunity to serve black viewers with TV 
programs that resonated with their values and experiences. The power of 
this story generated significant financial and cable channel resources. As 
a result, Black Entertainment Television (BET) was launched successfully 
in the United States (see www.bet.com).
As an illustration of an important story, consider the world’s energy chal-
lenge. Energy is the lifeblood of industrial civilization and necessary for lift-
ing the world’s poor out of poverty. However, current methods of mobilizing 
energy are highly disruptive of local and global environmental conditions and 
processes. Thus, the challenge is to develop a new, more favorable energy 
system and its associated sources. The resolution of this challenge will, it is 
hoped, be the discovery of an energy technology that can economically con-
vert solar energy to a locally useful form. One possibility is a solar conversion 
system yielding hydrogen to be used in fuel cells. Many technology ventures 
could exploit this opportunity favorably. It can become a great story with an 
 important outcome.
A well-told narrative plan that shows a difficult situation and a novel solu-
tion leading to improved market conditions can be galvanizing. When listeners 
can locate themselves in the story, their sense of commitment and involvement 
is enhanced. By conveying a powerful impression of the process of succeeding, 
narrative plans can motivate and mobilize resources and investors.
Stories help entrepreneurs deliver direction and inspiration more powerfully 
than a logical argument. Facts convey information, and stories convey meaning. 
Entrepreneurs need facts to back up their plans and a story to convey the goals 
and meaning of the venture [Gargiulo, 2002].
TABLE 6.3 Three stages of the story.
 1. Set the stage: Define the current situation, the current players, and the opportunities 
coherently and clearly. Life is in a delicate balance and the listener cares about the 
situation.
 2. Introduce the dramatic conflict: An inciting incident or need throws life out of balance. 
Describe the challenges and opportunities, and the need for a coherent plan to proceed 
toward success and a new balance.
 3. Reach a resolution: Portray a coherent plan describing how the new venture can over-
come the obstacles and succeed by following the plan.
A great story well told, therefore, will pack enough power to be memorable. 
We can forget bullet points, but a great story is unforgettable. It displays the

6.3   The Business Plan 127
struggle of expectation and hope versus reality and challenge [McKee, 2003]. 
An  example of an entrepreneur’s story follows:
My father and I were very close. In 1999, he exhibited congestive heart dis-
ease that appeared to be untreatable. While in the hospital for further tests, 
he died in the middle of the night. These tests were inadequate and failed my 
father and me. I have found and licensed a patent for a new blood test, but 
the Food and Drug Administration has been slow to respond, and the inven-
tor has gone on to other issues. Our early tests have shown good results for 
a low-cost test that can illuminate paths to a cure.
Our firm, Heartease, needs $1 million to complete our FDA certifica-
tion. We have the data and proof of the test’s efficacy. We need you on our 
team with your insights and money. Together, we can save your father or 
mother.
Ultimately, like a good book or movie, a story moves from an “inciting  incident” 
to a good ending. With the help of colleagues and allies, the entrepreneur turns chal-
lenges and obstacles into new opportunities and an outcome desired by all.
6.3 The Business Plan
Once an entrepreneurial team has selected an opportunity that is attractive and 
feasible, it often develops a detailed plan for describing the elements of the 
proposed business. A business plan is a document that describes the opportu-
nity, product, context, strategy, team, required resources, financial return, and 
harvest of a business venture. The elements of the business plan are listed in 
Table 6.4. This business plan can be used for many purposes, such as attract-
ing talented individuals and resources to the venture. Of course, there is no one 
right way to organize and write a business plan, and many successful companies 
never had a formal business plan [Brinckmann et al., 2010]. Although plans are 
never perfect, they help entrepreneurs nail down key details by forcing them to 
formalize their ideas.

CHAPTER 6   The Business Story and Plan128
As stated by Daniel Hudson Burnham (1909):
Make no little plans. They have no magic to stir men’s blood and prob-
ably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in hope and 
work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will never 
die, but long after we are gone will be a living thing, asserting itself with 
ever-growing insistency. Remember that our sons and grandsons are going 
to do things that would stagger us. Let your watchword be order and your 
beacon beauty.
The business plan is a blueprint for your business. The clarity of this plan 
will be enhanced by the entrepreneurial team over a period of weeks or months. 
It enables the team to see clearly the plan of action and understand all the ele-
ments. By crafting the business plan together, the team members also can ensure 
that their goals and assumptions align. Potential executives and other hires will 
often want to see the business plan, too, in order to assess the venture and their 
potential fit with it.
If the venture requires outside financing, a business plan will be required 
by most investors. Listing the assumptions underlying the financial plan will 
be helpful to all participants. Most useful plans number less than 20 pages with 
backup and supporting material available on request. 
A business plan is an important part of the business building process. Many 
businesses, however, start with a modestly crafted plan and build it up over the 
first months after launch. In other words, a business plan is a necessity, but it 
may not be required in a formal and complete form in order to start. In fact, 
in a dynamic industry such as semiconductors or nanotechnology, flexibility 
is key to success, and rigid adherence to a plan may be too limiting [Gruber, 
2007]. Thus, the team must recognize that the plan will need to be updated 
periodically. 
Creating a business plan teaches the team about the market, customers, 
and each other. A plan will probably turn up at least one or two big gaps, 
which can be corrected. Table 6.5 lists 10 common gaps that show up in a 
TABLE 6.5 Ten common mistakes or gaps in business plans.
 ■ Solutions or technologies looking for a 
problem
 ■ Unclear or incomplete business model 
and value proposition
 ■ Incomplete competitor analysis and mar-
keting plan
 ■ Inadequate description of the uncertain-
ties and risks
 ■ Gaps in capabilities required of the 
team
 ■ Inadequate description of revenue and 
profit drivers
 ■ Limited or no description of the metrics 
of the business
 ■ Lack of focus and a sound mission
 ■ Too many top-down assumptions such 
as “we will get 1 percent market share”
 ■ Limited confirmation of customer 
demand or pain

6.3   The Business Plan 129
business plan. The entrepreneurs can respond to these gaps or mistakes and 
seek to fix them.
A good business plan starts with a good understanding of the market, pur-
suit of a market that is either big or will be big, a defensible product plan that 
includes hard-to-copy intellectual property, and a go-to-market plan that has a 
cost-effective marketing and sales approach. It helps immensely if the entrepre-
neur has a background in previously building products for the market he or she 
plans to pursue. Ken Xie of Fortinet had such a plan. Ken was the founder of 
Netscreen, a company that was the recognized leader in remote secure-access 
products. He sold that company to Juniper for $3.5 billion. 
As a result of the experience that Xie had accumulated with Netscreen, he 
had a good understanding of the security market and was aware of problems 
that his customers were having with securing their networks. He knew that 
customers were using a number of application software products to stop secu-
rity threats. Managing multiple products was hard and even with those mul-
tiple products, outsiders were still penetrating corporate security. Xie felt that 
if he could build a single hardware network-security-appliance product that 
had superior capabilities in catching threats from outsiders, then corporations 
would be likely to buy such a solution. It would perform better, cost less, and 
be easier to administer than multiple software solutions. Xie knew the people 
who could build such a product as they had either worked for him in the past 
or worked for companies in the security industry that he had competed against 
in the past.
Xie assembled a top notch team and built Fortinet, a publicly held company 
on the NASDAQ that is now the recognized leader in Unified Threat Manage-
ment. Not only did he bring on excellent developers, he also hired sales and 
marketing personnel to implement the same channel partner sales methods at 
Fortinet that were successfully used at his prior company. 
Entrepreneurs like Xie are able to leverage their previous knowledge, rela-
tionships with customers, and relationships with domain experts to build both a 
great product and a successful go-to-market plan.
The business plan can be used to align the interests of all the participants of 
a new venture, as shown in Figure 6.3. The business plan explains how the peo-
ple, the resources, and the opportunity can be linked to a deal that will hopefully 
benefit all stakeholders—employees, investors, suppliers, and allies [ Sahlman, 
1999]. See Section 2.5 for a further discussion of proper fit and alignment neces-
sary for success.
After the business plan is outlined or drafted, the team should prepare an 
executive summary. The executive summary captures the essence of the busi-
ness plan and, for many new ventures, it stands alone as a short business plan. 
When readers finish the executive summary, they should have a good sense of 
what the entrepreneurs are trying to do in their business. A successful executive 
summary captures the readers’ attention and imagination, causing them to want 
to learn more.

6.4   The Elevator Pitch 131
Intuit’s Elevator Pitch
During the founding of Intuit, Scott Cook described his venture in this way: 
“Homemakers need to pay the family’s bills. They hate the hassle of bill 
collection and payment. They need a software computer program to quickly 
and easily pay their bills. Other programs are too slow and too hard to 
learn. Our solution is a fast, easy-to-use program with no instruction books 
needed. So the bill payer needs Quicken!”
6.4 The Elevator Pitch
Often entrepreneurs have a chance to make their case to a potential investor or 
ally. The importance of a compelling story was discussed in Section 6.2. A short 
version of the new venture story is often called the elevator pitch, which gets 
its name from the two-minute opportunity to tell a story during an elevator ride. 
Chance meetings (in places such as elevators) will offer opportunities to entre-
preneurs to make a brief case for their venture. A prepared short version of the 
venture story can be a powerful door opener. 
The goal of the short story is to get approval to proceed to the next step, 
where the entrepreneur can tell the longer version of the story and secure new 
colleagues, allies, and investors. Thus, the entrepreneur must recognize that 
there isn’t time to elaborate on many details. Instead he or she must quickly con-
vey the essence of the opportunity in a way that invites a longer conversation. A 
short version of the venture story demonstrates that the entrepreneurs know their 
business and can communicate it effectively. 
The short version of the venture story starts with an introduction, moves into 
a description of the opportunity, and then describes the potential benefits of the 
new venture. The secret of strong short stories is in grabbing the attention of lis-
teners, convincing them with the promise of mutual benefit, and setting the stage 
for follow-up. The story can start with a captivating question such as: “If IKEA 
can provide babysitting, why can’t movie theaters?” 
The short version of the story should convey the vision of the venture. In the 
case of Genentech, it is: “We discover and make biotechnology pharmaceutical 
products to reduce or overcome the effects of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and 
cancer diseases.” An important vision can provide the inspiration for the venture 
and its short story.
There are techniques that a storyteller can employ to make the pitch memo-
rable. First, the storyteller should speak in terms the listeners can understand and 
should focus on one simple message. Second, the storyteller should use concrete 
images and examples rather than ambiguous or abstract phrases. Third, the sto-
ryteller should generate interest and curiosity by exposing gaps in current solu-
tions and then filling these gaps through the proposed new venture. Ideally, this 
will cause an emotional response from the listeners. Finally, the storyteller must 
be passionate about the idea, demonstrating a genuine attachment to the problem 
and solution [Heath and Heath, 2007].

CHAPTER 6   The Business Story and Plan132
Writing a complete business plan forces the entrepreneurs to crystallize key 
business issues in their minds. There are many ways to structure a business plan, 
with various references, structures, and templates available. The business plan 
process focuses on the venture’s key success factors by posing questions that 
must be addressed for an idea to become a true opportunity. The remaining con-
tent of this section proposes questions for each part of a typical business plan. 
An example of a well-prepared executive summary is provided in appendix A. 
See the textbook’s websites for additional plans and resources.
Executive Summary
The executive summary is the most important part of the business plan. Many 
investors make their decision to proceed with further discussions (e.g., due dili-
gence) based on this single section. The executive summary should encapsulate 
the key positioning and reasoning found in the rest of the business plan. Both 
the vision and mission statements should assist in succinctly communicating a 
compelling opportunity.
■ Why is this a big problem and why are customers willing to pay for 
solutions?
■ How does the venture plan on solving the customer problem or need?
■ Why is this venture uniquely positioned to do this?
■ How attractive are the economics? Why is this an exciting growth opportunity?
■ Who is the team, and what key partnerships are in place?
I. Opportunity and Market Analysis
Investors like funding big problems representing large opportunities. Start strong 
by demon strating a solid understanding of the customer and why this problem or 
pain is important to him or her. Performing customer segmentation will convince 
readers that the venture can grow to the size of the addressable market.
■ What is the problem or need being solved by the venture?
■ Who is the customer or customer segment(s)?
■ How large is the total addressable market, and how much is it growing?
■ How is the current market context favorable or not?
Reference: Chapters 2, 3, and 4
II. The Solution and Concept
Many product descriptions lose credibility by being too “big picture,” relying 
on market hype, or being too product-focused in the hopes that simply explain-
ing the technology will make it evident why the idea is valuable. It is impor-
tant to balance the use of technical or industry-specific lingo with common,

everyday language. In addition, detailing a value proposition and business 
model will ensure that the economics of the business are sound from the start.
■ What is the product or service?
■ Describe a “day-in-the-life” of the customer before and after adoption of 
the solution. What is the value proposition to a customer, and why it is 
compelling for the customer?
■ Which customers have validated the product and are willing to pay for it?
■ What is unique and defendable about the business?
■ What is the business and economic model? How attractive are the financial 
margins?
Reference: Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 16
III. Marketing and Sales
This section of the business plan should clearly communicate an understanding of 
how to successfully market and sell your product to the identified customer seg-
ments. Understand ing and communicating your customer development strategy 
are as important as your product development strategy. It should be done in sync 
with product development to improve the odds of success. Your business model 
and pricing strategy should also extend clearly into the selected sales strategies.
■ What are the most appropriate marketing mediums to reach the customer 
segment(s)?
■ What is the most appropriate type of sales channel for the product (e.g., 
direct vs. indirect sales)?
■ Who is the customer decision maker with purchasing power, and who 
influences that person to buy?
■ What is the expected sales cycle length?
■ Are there partnerships that can be leveraged to advertise and sell?
Reference: Chapters 4 and 9
IV. Product Development and Operations
At this point, the reader should be convinced that the entrepreneurs have identi-
fied a compelling market and know how to generate revenue. This section focuses 
on product development and how the product will be made marketable. Any key 
technologies being leveraged for development should be explained clearly (e.g., dia-
grams are helpful). Demon strate that continued revenue growth is planned by speci-
fying long-term product goals. This section largely drives the amount and timing of 
cash required for the business, making it a critical component of the financial model.
■ What is the current state of development of the product(s)?
■ What resources will be required to finish and ship the product? Be specific 
about what types of resources will be required (e.g., engineering, tools, 
suppliers, materials, partners, and customer involvement).

■ What are the planned development timelines and key milestones targeted?
■ What are the key risks that will be mitigated at each milestone?
■ What does the value chain look like for production and product delivery?
■ Do any patents, trade secrets, or other defendable advantages exist?
■ Are there any regulatory hurdles that must be cleared?
Reference: Chapters 5, 8, 13, and 14
V. Team and Organization
Building a team is a critical part of beginning a new venture and communicat-
ing credibly to outside parties. Understanding how the current team fits into the 
broader venture vision will help investors and partners understand what roles 
remain to be filled and how they can potentially assist.
■ What are the backgrounds and roles of the founders and early key 
employees?
■ Describe the passions and skills of the team and why the team is committed 
to the opportunity.
■ What key hires must be made to fill out the team?
■ What head count levels are forecasted in each functional department?
■ Does the company have advisors or board members that strengthen its 
story?
Reference: Chapters 10, 12, and 20
VI. Risks
A new venture is confronted with four major types of risk: technology/product, 
market/compe tition, management/team, and financial. Many of the opportunity-
specific risks are interwoven into earlier parts of the business plan. For instance, 
potential competitive threats should be considered when framing both the prod-
uct and go-to-market sections. In addressing company-specific risks, it is impor-
tant to think clearly about how each risk factor can be managed in the coming 
year or two. Quantitative analysis will also aid the reader. It is critical to identify 
which risks need to be reduced so that the reader will be confident that the entre-
preneurs understand how to build a business.
■ What are the key product development risks and external dependencies?
■ What is being done to mitigate product execution risks?
■ Who are your main competitors, and how are you differentiated from them in 
the marketplace?
■ Can large players easily enter the market? Are there product substitutes?
■ What customer, partner, or product strategies can be used to mitigate 
competitive threats?

VII. Financial Plan and Investment Offering
Although the financial plan is considered last, the implications of financial 
 decisions appear throughout. If the company executes successfully across 
 product development, marketing, sales, and other company functions, the finan-
cial results must be attractive enough to make an investment. Ensure that any 
financial assumptions and results are feasible by citing an enterprise that is 
analogous to the planned venture. Investors want to know how much funding 
is required and what measurable milestones will be reached. Staged financing 
allows both investors and entrepreneurs to better manage the risk associated 
with a new venture. Include a timeline that integrates company sales and product 
milestones, planned funding events, and cash flow position.
■ What is the required funding to meet the market and product milestone 
goals? What amount is being asked for?
■ When is the venture forecasted to be cash-flow positive?
■ What is the growth opportunity of the business if successful?
■ What are the forecasted initial and steady-state financial margins?
■ What other companies exhibit margins and growth similar to this venture?
■ What are the key financial assumptions?
Reference: Chapters 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19
Appendix. Detailed Financial Plan
A more detailed set of financial projections and assumptions are generally 
included in an appen dix. The forecasted financials and assumptions will serve as 
a starting point for valuing the venture. Be sure the methodology used to arrive 
at the financials is transparent to the reader.
■ Five-year detailed cash-flow statement, income statement, and balance 
sheet (monthly for first year and quarterly or yearly thereafter).
■ Financial assumptions made in the construction of the financial estimates 
(e.g., customer penetration rates, pricing, and working capital assumptions).
■ Are purchasing decisions cyclical in this industry?
■ What are the largest costs of the business (e.g., engineering development, 
regulatory trials, manufacturing, and marketing)?
■ How will product and sales costs change as volume grows?
■ Has customer support and maintenance been factored in?

CHAPTER 6   The Business Story and Plan136
Building a business is described as a process that can be learned and mastered by 
talented and educated entrepreneurs by developing the following descriptions:
■ Opportunity, vision, value proposition, and business model.
■ Concept, feasibility, and story.
■ Financial plan, legal form, and business plan.
■ Resource acquisition plan.
■ Execution and launch process.
We note that entrepreneurs have a story and business plan that helps them to 
 codify and communicate their roadmap to achievement. Most entrepreneurs 
 benefit from putting this plan into written form to sharpen their thinking, commu-
nicate it well to others, and enable testing of critical assumptions and hypothesis. 
6.7 Summary
Principle 6
Entrepreneurs can learn and master a process for building a new venture 
and they communicate their intentions by developing a story and writ-
ing a business plan.

bookstores stocked a small percentage of all available titles and they charged a 
considerable markup to cover the cost of their stores and personnel. Moreover, 
publishers had little information on who purchased specific titles, which limited 
their marketing efforts. Bezos proposed Amazon as a means of cutting costs 
while delivering greater value to both the customers and the publishers.
In 1995, Bezos wrote his business plan, detailing the people, resources, 
opportunity, and deal (Figure 6.3). He hired a team, developed the website, and 
launched Amazon.com. Over time, Amazon has expanded its product offerings. 
In 2006, they launched a cloud computing service; in 2011, they entered the tab-
let computing market with the Kindle Fire; and in 2013, they launched the Auto-
Rip digital music service. Amazon continues to execute upon its vision even as 
it moves into new markets.

 7.7 Summary
How can the uncertainty and risks of  ventures 
seeking to scale and grow be managed 
 effectively to achieve success?
A 
new venture that creates a novel solution 
to a problem will be subject to uncertainty 
of outcome. An action in an uncertain 
market is sure to experience a risk of delay or loss. 
It is the entrepreneur’s task to reduce and manage 
all risks as much as possible.
Attractive new ventures can be designed to 
grow as demand for their products increases. Fur-
thermore, it is hoped that economies of scale will 
be experienced so that as demand and sales grow, 
the cost to produce a unit of product declines. Addi-
tionally, it is desirable to have economies of scope 
so that costs per unit decline due to the spreading 
of fixed costs over a wide range of products. Many 
industries established on a network format exhibit 
network economies resulting in a reinforcing char-
acteristic leading to the emergence of an industry 
standard.

CHAPTER 7   Risk and Return140
The pursuit of important opportunities and big goals by entrepreneurs requires 
them to assume more risks than they might take on working for a mature company 
or the government. Introducing a novel product into a new market has an uncer-
tain outcome. An outcome resulting from an action is said to be certain when it 
will definitely happen. Something certain is reliable or guaranteed. For example, 
it is certain that if we drop a rock, it will fall to the ground (and not float upward).
An outcome resulting from an action is said to be uncertain when the out-
come is not known or is likely to be variable. Risk is the chance or possibility 
of loss. This loss could be financial, physical, or reputational. When Christopher 
Columbus embarked on his first voyage to the New World, he risked financial, 
reputational, and bodily harm. Farmers are a group whose fortunes are vulnerable 
to unpredictable outcomes due to drought, flood, or other weather conditions.
Most, perhaps almost all, people are risk-averse or risk-avoiders. Logically, 
an entrepreneur seeks to avoid or reduce the risk of an action. For example, 
farmers purchase insurance to mitigate the effects of uncertain weather. A sim-
ple measure of a person’s risk aversion is provided in the following example of 
a coin toss game [Bernstein, 1996].
7.1 Risk and Uncertainty
Example: A Coin Toss Game
You have a choice of receiving $50 for certain or an opportunity to play a 
coin toss game in which you have a 50 percent chance of winning $100. 
The $50 gift is certain, if you elect it. The game’s outcome is uncertain, 
but the expected outcome over the long run is (if you play it many times) 
also $50 since, for a true coin, the probability of winning, P, is 50 percent. 
Surely, you would play the game if the probability, P, of winning were 100 
percent. Would you play if the probability were 70 percent? What is the 
probability, P, that you would require to play? If your P 570 percent, you 
are risk-averse, and if your P540 percent, you are a risk-seeker. Of course, 
your willingness to play this game will also depend on your overall wealth 
in relation to the $50 outcome of loss and the fun of playing this simple 
game. This game illustrates the fact that most people, perhaps like you, are 
risk-averse.
Entrepreneurs are often thought of as risk takers. Most good entrepreneurs, 
however, are relentless about managing risk [Gilbert and Eyring, 2010]. The 
 ability to successfully choose the risks worth bearing is a form of human capital 
based on experience and good judgment [Davis and Meyer, 2000]. We usually 
assume that the elevated risk of an entrepreneurial venture may provide a higher 
return on this human capital. Entrepreneurs often have a capability to limit the 
downside risks of a venture by applying their skills that are useful for mitigating 
the risks. One mental model may be the circus high-wire walker with a strong

net below. In fact, most successful entrepreneurial firms create value by taking 
calculated risks and possess the core competency to mitigate or manage these 
risks. All of life is the management of risk, not its elimination [Brown, 2005].
The entrepreneur is in many ways like an investment manager who chooses 
to pursue selected opportunities and not others. When we analyze risk, we look 
forward in time and try to estimate the potential outcome and the variability of 
that outcome. Risk is a measure of the potential variability of outcomes that will 
be experienced in the future. Furthermore, risk is the chance or possibility of 
loss. Table 7.1 lists the four possible levels of uncertainty [Courtney, 2001]. The 
level of return on investment we might expect should be commensurate with the 
level of uncertainty.
Entrepreneurs practice in the realm of opportunity in a manner similar to 
what financial investors do in the stock market [Sternberg et al., 1997]. They 
pursue opportunities with expected levels of risk and attempt to “buy low and sell 
high.” Buying low means pursuing ideas that are not widely recognized or are 
out of favor. Selling high means finding a cash buyer for the successful venture, 
convincing the buyer that its worth will yield a significant return and it is time 
to harvest some of the wealth already created. As with any investment, “invest 
in a business you understand” is a good principle. Thus, pursuing the hope of 
fusion power should be left to those few who know and understand this big but 
risky opportunity. The entrepreneur-investor assumes the risk of the venture and 
should be willing to take on sizable risks with the knowledge that he or she can 
manage or mitigate them.
The best method for most entrepreneurs is to use a form of experimentation—
trial and error. Identify possible new ventures and take a few steps toward a busi-
ness and then evaluate the early feedback. If it looks good, keep going forward. 
Entrepreneurs will most likely take the risk of failure if the losses are constrained 
on the downside and the potential rewards are high on the upside [Sull, 2004]. 
Henry Ford said: “Failure is the opportunity to begin again, more intelligently.”
Successful entrepreneurs also rank risks in order of importance and afford-
ability, with deal killers listed first, strategic risks second, and operational risks 
third. They also recognize dependencies in their business plan, where a failure

CHAPTER 7   Risk and Return142
or delay in one area of the plan will impact other areas of the plan. With these 
risks identified and ranked, an entrepreneur can then work toward managing or 
reducing the most critical risks first—before they have invested too much in the 
venture [Gilbert and Eyring, 2010].
Entrepreneur-investors should consider the concept of regret, which we 
define as the amount of loss a person can tolerate. People treat regret of loss dif-
ferently than the potential of possible gain. How much regret people feel varies 
depending on their circumstances of wealth, age, and psychological well-being. 
Reconsider the simple coin toss game. If you play the game and lose $50 on the 
first turn, it may be disturbing. Your level of regret may be $200. If you play 
a sequence of four turns and lose each of them, you will reach your  level of 
regret. Thus, entrepreneurs need to evaluate their regret level of acceptable loss 
and limit their investment in any entrepreneurial venture. If an entrepreneur can 
forgo one year of income ($50,000) and willingly invest his or her savings of 
$60,000 in the venture, then the entrepreneur’s level of regret is $110,000.
The amount of risk entrepreneurs will endure varies, but most retain 
some personal financial reserve so that failure will not equate to  homelessness 
or starvation. It is easier to be a risk taker if one has some reserves to fall 
back on.
The risk-adjusted value of a venture, V, is
 V 5 U 2 λR (7.1)
where U 5 upside, λ 5 risk-adjusted constant, usually greater than 1, and R 5 
downside or regret. The larger the value of λ, the more risk-averse is the 
 entrepreneur. We are neutral at λ 5 1 but risk-averse at λ 5 2 (Dembo and 
 Freeman, 1998). If your regret is R 5 $110,000 and λ 5 2, to proceed requires 
V . 0, or
 U . λR (7.2)
Therefore, the required upside, U, is U . $220,000. Entrepreneurs can use 
 scenarios and economic analysis to estimate the potential upside, U, of a  venture.
The strategic response to uncertainty is to build a venture in stages, reserv-
ing the right to adjust your core competencies and strategies, and play again 
at the next stage. Thus, reconsidering the case of the entrepreneur who is risk-
averse with λ 5 2, he or she can choose to proceed for six months with the 
venture so that R 5 $55,000, and the minimum upside required is then only 
$110,000. After the six months, the entrepreneur adjusts the business strategy to 
improve the business performance and based on a new calculation of the upside, 
U, proceeds to a second stage of activity or decides to terminate the venture.
To perform the kinds of analyses appropriate to high levels of uncer-
tainty, most firms will need to enhance their strategic capabilities. Scenario- 
planning techniques can be useful for determining strategy under conditions 
of  uncertainty.
Risk reflects the degree of uncertainty and the potential loss associated with 
the outcomes, which may follow from an action or set of actions. Risk consists

of two elements: the significance of the potential losses and the uncertainty of 
those losses. In most new ventures, it is the significance or size of the potential 
losses, hazard, and the uncertainty that are estimated by new venture entrepre-
neurs and their investors. We propose a measure of risk as:
 Risk 5 hazard 3 uncertainty (7.3)
The hazard, H, is the size of the potential losses as perceived by the entrepre-
neurial team. Hazard is an entrepreneur’s income forgone (opportunity cost, OC) 
plus the financial investment, I, which he or she will need to make. Therefore,
 Risk 5 (I 1 OC) 3 UC (7.4)
The uncertainty, UC, is measured by the variability in anticipated outcomes, 
which may be described by their estimate of the probability of loss (failure). 
Based on these factors, the entrepreneurial team may make a selection of a new 
venture (or to proceed or not), as shown in Figure 7.1. High levels of hazard 
may not deter entrepreneurs from choosing ventures with potentially high  levels 
of returns. The decision to proceed or not depends on the level of risk  adversity

of the team members and their perception of the extent of the uncertainty. Of 
course, the estimate of potential returns is subject to the assumptions  underlying 
their calculation.
An entrepreneurial venture is launched with a degree of uncertainty due 
to the novelty of the product to the market, the novelty of the production 
processes, and the novelty to management [Shepherd et al., 2000]. Novelty 
to the  market concerns the lack of uncertainty of the market and customer 
 uncertainty.  Novelty of production processes is dependent on the extent of 
knowledge of the processes by the venture team. Novelty to management con-
cerns the venture team’s lack of the necessary competencies. Regulation and 
legal changes are also a source of uncertainty. Sources of uncertainty are listed 
in Table 7.2.

7.1   Risk and Uncertainty 145
The risk of failure or poor performance is significant and should not be 
understated. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, about one-
half of all small businesses are acquired by another firm or leave the market 
within four years. Of course, being acquired at a good price may be the success 
one is seeking. It is fair to say that one-fourth of all business start-ups are discon-
tinued within four years, but it is unclear at what cost or return.
Technology ventures usually have four types of risk: technology, market, 
financial, and team. Every effort should be made to test the assumptions about 
these four sources of risk. Strategic risk management involves setting up strate-
gies that anticipate the downside of risk. The key to surviving risks is assessment 
and response [Slywotzky and Drzik, 2005].
Technology entrepreneurs are often less concerned with certainty than with 
getting into the game quickly and learning how to participate. The uncertainty and 
associated risks decline as the novelty in the three dimensions of market, produc-
tion, and management declines. Novelty is synonymous with uncertainty, and, 
thus, we expect uncertainty to decline as knowledge of the market, the processes, 
and management competencies improves. Thus, the liability of newness declines 
over time. A process for managing risk and uncertainty is shown in Figure 7.2.
Whenever there is uncertainty, there is usually the possibility of reducing it 
by the acquisition of information. Indeed, information is essentially the nega-
tive of uncertainty. The acquisition of information and knowledge improves

an organization’s chances of adaptation and performance. An entrepreneur is 
 continuously making decisions about highly uncertain environments and the 
new venture’s internal structures that, in turn, modify the venture’s performance 
outcomes. New venture managers may learn from past choices about how to 
perform  better in the future. This learning can facilitate adaptation to changed 
environmental conditions since the strategic choices of managers help define 
the outcomes. An appropriate strategy for risk reduction uses new information 
learned from experience to adjust the business strategy and the actions taken to 
 execute the strategy. Appropriate strategies might include adding new people to 
the team, creating new alliances, reducing costs, or improving customer relation-
ships, among others.
Arthur Pitney received a patent in 1902 for a hand-operated postage meter 
that he hoped would be used to replace stamps for mass mailings. Pitney rec-
ognized his primary source of risk was regulatory since the U.S. Post Office 
controlled postage services. By 1918, after continual rejections, Pitney was 
joined by Walter Bowes to form Pitney Bowes and try again to get Post Office 
approval. With Bowes’s persuasive skills, they finally received a license for the 
postage meter in 1920. They ultimately overcame the regulatory hazards to build 
up their firm. Many entrepreneurs underestimate their various risks.
Symantec: Risk and Reward
In 1981, Gordon Eubanks, a software pioneer in the personal computer 
industry, cofounded C&E Software to develop an integrated database 
management and word processor product. In 1983, John Doerr, who was 
a venture capitalist with Silicon Valley’s Kleiner Perkins Caufield and 
Byers (KPCB), approached Eubanks regarding one of his investments. 
Symantec was an artificial intelligence software firm that was strug-
gling to stay afloat despite having an interesting technology known as 
natural language recognition. Doerr suggested that Eubanks merge with 
Symantec and incorporate Symantec’s technology into C&E’s product 
(see Figure 7.2). Although Eubanks viewed this technology integration as 
a compromise, he was persuaded by the upside of the deal—a substantial 
percentage of ownership for C&E in the merged venture, an additional 
cash investment from KPCB, and a chance to lead the new company. In 
late 1984, Symantec Corporation was reborn as a firm  that developed 
a natural language database manager with word  processing capabilities.
Even with the additional venture capital funds, it became apparent that 
Symantec would not survive as a one-product company. A few months 
before the first version of Symantec’s database manager shipped in 1985, 
Eubanks hired Tom Byers to search for new revenue streams and to diver-
sify the product line. Byers realized that a market existed for software 
utilities that added features to the then-popular Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet.

7.1   Risk and Uncertainty 147
Symantec used a strategy similar to book publishing with these products: 
in return for the rights to package and sell the software, Symantec paid 
developers a royalty as the product’s author. Eubanks had adjusted Syman-
tec’s strategy in response to risk and uncertainty.
In 1987, Eubanks further diversified the firm. Symantec purchased 
Breakthrough Software for minimal cash and a $10 million note payable 
in cash if and when Symantec went public. Timeline, Breakthrough’s proj-
ect management software, quickly doubled Symantec’s incoming revenue, 
which was important because sales of Lotus utilities were rapidly declining.
Also in the late 1980s, Eubanks quickly acted on two emerging trends 
in the industry. First was the proliferation of computer viruses as more 
and more computers were connected in networks. Second was the rapid 
advancements of graphical user interfaces (GUI) in personal  computers 
such as the Macintosh. To rapidly respond to these changing conditions, 
Eubanks made several key decisions and acquisitions.
Ted Schlein, who worked for Byers in Symantec’s publishing division, 
identified a market for antivirus software and pushed for Symantec to publish 
Symantec Antivirus for Macintosh (SAM), which became the first suc-
cessful commercial antivirus product. In following years, Symantec made 
numerous acquisitions in this category, including Peter Norton Comput-
ing; network security eventually became Symantec’s core business. In 
addition, Eubanks acquired two Macintosh software companies whose 
developers were very experienced in GUI-based software. These acquisi-
tions helped prepare the company for the subsequent decade in which all 
PC software was based either on Windows or Macintosh user interfaces.
Finally, marketing and distributing Symantec’s growing line of soft-
ware became vital to its success. Recognizing that the software industry 
was rapidly maturing with large corporations becoming most important, 
Eubanks hired John Laing as head of global sales and Bob Dykes as CFO. 
Laing and Dykes, experienced professionals who had worked in large busi-
ness operations in the past, created the necessary systems and processes to 
handle the upcoming rapid growth.
In 1989, Symantec went public with 264 employees, $40 million 
in sales, net income of $3 million, and 15 products. During the 1990s, 
Eubanks focused Symantec on network security technology. In 1999, 
Eubanks stepped down as CEO of Symantec, and John Thompson from 
IBM took the reigns. Thompson continued the tradition of focusing the 
entire product line around enterprise security. Symantec expanded into 
the market of overall data reliability by merging with Veritas in 2005, 
becoming one of the largest software companies in the world. In 2012, 
Symantec had revenues of nearly $7 billion, more than 20,500 employ-
ees, operations in over 40 countries, and a market capitalization of 
over $12 billion. Industry leaders like Symantec continuously manage 
risk and return.

CHAPTER 7   Risk and Return148
Businesses can manage the problem of unpredictable customer behavior by 
following the ideas of portfolio management. The portfolio of customers should 
be diversified so as to produce the desired returns at the particular level of uncer-
tainty the firm can tolerate. Customers are risky assets. As with stocks, the cost 
of acquiring them is supposed to reflect the cash-flow values they are likely to 
generate. The concept of risk-adjusted lifetime value of a customer has a trans-
forming power [Dhar, 2003].
To the uninitiated, successful new ventures appear to be the right idea at the 
right time. However, entrepreneurs put the pieces together so that while it looks 
like a happenstance, it is actually the entrepreneur who makes it happen with 
good calculations based on sound information. As Charles Kemmon  Wilson, the 
founder of Holiday Inn, said [Jakle et al., 1996]: “Opportunity comes often. It 
knocks as often as you have an ear trained to hear it, an eye trained to see it, a 
hand trained to grasp it, and a head trained to use it.”
One way to calculate an estimate of a new venture’s potential risk and 
reward is to answer the four questions posed in Table 7.3. In general, the entre-
preneur seeks a venture where the return is expected to significantly exceed the 
potential losses.
TABLE 7.3 Estimating risk and reward.
1.  Describe the most likely scenario, the expected reward, and its estimated probability.
2.  Describe the worst-case scenario, the expected loss, and its estimated probability.
3.   Describe the best-case scenario, the expected reward, and the estimated probability of it 
occurring.
4.   Determine how much the entrepreneurial team and their investors can afford to lose. 
Include their investment and opportunity costs.
7.2 Scale and Scope
In this section, we consider the strategic impacts of the scale and scope of a 
firm. The scale of a firm is the extent of the activity of a firm as described by 
its size. The scale of a firm’s activity can be described by its revenues, units 
sold, or some other measure of size. Economies of scale are expected based 
on the concept that larger quantities of units sold will result in reduced per-unit 
costs. Economies of scale are generally achieved by distributing fixed costs such 
as rent, general and administrative expenses, and other overhead over a larger 
quantity, q, of units sold. This effect is portrayed in Figure 7.3. The cost per unit 
decreases, reaching a minimum at q
m. Often, the cost per unit will increase for 
q . qm, since the complexity of coordination may increase costs per unit for a 
high number of units.
When significant economies of scale exist in manufacturing, distribution, 
service, or other functions of a business, larger firms (up to some point) have 
a cost advantage over smaller firms. Thus, smaller, new-entrant firms need to 
bye23429_ch07_139-162.indd   148bye23429_ch07_139-162.indd   148 10/11/13   3:34 PM10/11/13   3:34 PM

differentiate their product on qualities other than price. As the smaller, new-
entrant firm grows in size, it can also learn to reduce its costs per unit and price 
competitively with larger firms.

FIGURE 7.3 Economies of scale.
Google’s Competitive Advantage
Google’s sustainable competitive advantage is tied to its innovation 
underlying its search engine. Search engines for the Web are based on 
computer science algorithms and need to search without failure [Hardy, 
2003]. A search on Google offers great results and keeps people coming 
back. Revenues for Google were estimated at $100 million in 2001, only 
three years after starting up. In 2004, Google raised $1.2 billion in its 
initial public offering. By 2013, its revenues were more than $50 billion. 
Its primary source of revenues is from advertising on its pages. It gets 
its fees by selling rights to given keywords so an ad shows up first when 
those words are entered. With an enormous volume of searches, Google 
now benefits from tremendous economies of scale.
Another issue related to scale is the concept of scalability. Scalability refers 
to how big a firm can grow in various dimensions to provide more service. 
There are several measures of scalability. They include volume or quantity sold 
per year, revenues, and number of customers. These dimensions are not inde-
pendent, as scaling up the size of a firm in one dimension can affect the other 
bye23429_ch07_139-162.indd   149bye23429_ch07_139-162.indd   149 10/11/13   3:34 PM10/11/13   3:34 PM

dimensions. Easily scalable ventures are attractive, while ventures that are dif-
ficult to grow are less so.
The consequence of growth is the necessity to respond by increasing capac-
ity. Capacity is the ability to act or do something. Any firm has processes, assets, 
inventory, cash, and other factors that must be expanded as the company grows 
its sales volume. A firm that can easily grow its capacity is said to be readily 
scalable. For example, as a firm grows, its working capital requirements will 
grow. Working capital is a firm’s current assets minus its current liabilities. 
Sources of working capital for an emerging firm can include long- and short-
term borrowing, the sales of fixed assets, new capital infusions, and net income. 
The ability for a new firm to grow will be influenced by its access to new capital 
and assets. Managing a firm for scalability is important to its success. To pre-
empt or match competitors, a firm must attempt to foresee increases in demand 
and then move rapidly to be able to satisfy the predicted demand. This strategy 
can be risky since it involves investing in resources before the extent of the 
demand is verified. The total cost, TC, of the production of units is described as:
 TC 5 FC 1 VC (7.5)
where FC is the fixed costs that do not vary with the quantity of production. The 
variable costs, VC, do vary with the quantity produced where VC 5 c 3 q, c 
being the cost/unit and the quantity being q. This relationship is shown in 
 Figure 7.4. Table 7.4 describes the scalability and economies of scale for four 
types of businesses.

7.2   Scale and Scope 151
The advantage of a talent-based business such as a consulting firm is that 
the start-up funds are low. The firm is scalable as long as new talent can be 
recruited for expansion, but it has few economies of scale. The advantage of 
a firm based on a mixture of talent and physical assets is that it can expand 
as long as it can secure the necessary funds. A physical asset-based business 
such as a steel company must secure new plants and equipment as it grows, 
requiring capital infusion. An information-based business must invest funds 
upfront to create the software or a movie. It has low variable costs and high 
economies of scale.
The scope of a firm is the range of products offered or distribution chan-
nels utilized (or both). The sharing of resources such as manufacturing facili-
ties, distribution channels, and other factors by multiple products or business 
units gives rise to economies of scope. For example, the cost per unit of 
Procter & Gamble’s advertising and sales activities is low because it is spread 
over a wide range of products. Procter & Gamble’s disposable diaper and 
paper towel businesses demonstrate a successful realization of economies of 
scope. These businesses share the costs of procuring certain raw materials 
and developing the technology for new products and processes. In addition, 
a sales force sells both products to supermarket buyers, and both products 
are shipped by means of the same distribution system. This resource sharing 
has given both business units a cost advantage compared to their  competitors 
[Hill and Jones, 2001].

CHAPTER 7   Risk and Return152
The economies of scale and scope both reduce the cost per unit. For a fac-
tory, its throughput—the amount processed within a given time—needs to 
be consistently high. The introduction of the railroad to the United States and 
Europe reduced the travel time between markets and supply, increasing the 
flow of raw materials to factories. The revolution in railroad transportation and 
telegraph communication resulted in great increases in throughput. In 1870, the 
Union Pacific Railroad joined the Central Pacific at Promontory, Utah, spanning 
the United States [Beatty, 2001]. The United States became the world’s lead-
ing industrial producer by 1929. The economies of scale and scope helped the 
United States to become a low-cost producer and distributor of goods.
The strategy of a new firm must incorporate plans for economies of scale and 
scope. Global Solar is an emerging California company whose fundamental busi-
ness model depends on economies of scale. Global Solar uses a new technology, 
called the compact linear fresnel reflector, to gather sunlight and generate elec-
tricity by boiling water and spinning a turbine. Solar thermal power plants require 
large numbers of mirrors to concentrate adequate heat on the boiler. This need for 
a large mirror farm requires Global Solar’s power plants to be much bigger than 
most other solar start-ups. In 2008, Global Solar constructed the first U.S. manu-
facturing plant for solar thermal systems to test out its new technology in the field.
Facebook: Seeking Economies of Scope
Facebook is a very popular social networking site with a significant market 
share in the United States and Europe. Seeking to take advantage of its 
large user base, it launched the Facebook Platform in 2007. This allowed 
any developer to program small Web applications for users to add to their 
profiles. These applications take advantage of Facebook’s comprehensive 
social connectivity capabilities and include games, event publicizing, gift-
giving, and video sharing among others. By 2013, over 9 million appli-
cations and websites integrated with Facebook. Facebook is attracting 
developers seeking to take advantage of the massive economies of scope 
resulting from Facebook’s success in the market.
7.3 Network Effects and Increasing Returns
In recent years, realization has been growing that network economies are an 
important element of competitive economics for new entrepreneurial firms. 
 Network economies arise in industries where a network of complementary 
products is a determinant of demand (also called network effects). For example, 
the demand for telephones is dependent on the number of other telephones that 
can be called with a telephone. As more people get telephones, the value of a 
telephone increases, thus leading to increased demand for telephones. This pro-
cess is called a positive feedback loop since as more people use the process, the 
value to users of the process increases and thus demand goes up, leading to more 
people using the process.

7.3   Network Effects and Increasing Returns 153
The positive feedback process for Windows-Intel (Wintel) personal com-
puters is illustrated in Figure 7.5. As the number of Wintel PCs increases, the 
incentive for the development of software applications increases (a complemen-
tary product). With more application software available, the PC is more valuable 
to a user. As the value of a PC increases, the demand for Wintel PCs increases, 
leading to an increased number of Wintel PCs.
Networks include telephone networks, railroad networks, airline networks, 
fax machine networks, computer networks, ATM networks, and the Internet, 
among others. The overall tendency is toward “bigger is better.” As Figure 7.6 
indicates, over time, a winner emerges (company A) and the competitors decline. 
In the PC industry, Wintel captured the largest market share, with Apple holding 
the rest of the market. In general, network effects exhibit reinforcing character-
istics, as shown in Figure 7.7.
The value of a network, according to Bob Metcalfe [Shapiro and Varian, 
1998], is approximately:
 value of network 5 kn
2 (7.6)
where k is a constant to be determined for each industry sector and n is the num-
ber of participants in the network. Based on this model, the value of a network 
grows rapidly as n grows. This simple model assumes all participants are equally 
valuable, which is not always true. The incentive to a firm in a network economy 
is to secure market share, eventually taking off toward dominance. This is the 
underlying theory behind Amazon.com and other Internet start-ups. Of course, 
market share can grow rapidly while profitability may be elusive. A balance of 
both market share and profitability can lead an entrepreneurial firm to eventual

Network economies work when revenues grow faster than costs. In the 
late 1990s Webvan tried to become the online grocer of choice in the United 
States. It had to invest in warehousing, trucks, and logistic systems, which led

to increased costs and inventories, which caused its costs to spiral upward faster 
than its revenues, eventually sinking the firm into bankruptcy.
Increasing returns mean that the marginal benefits of a good or of an 
activity are growing with the total quantity of the good or the activity con-
sumed or produced [Van den Ende and Wijaberg, 2003]. Increasing returns is 
the tendency for a company that is ahead, firm A in Figure 7.6, to get  farther 
ahead. The theory is that the firm that has a successful product that is increas-
ingly becoming the standard for the industry will experience increasing returns 
as increasing quantities are sold. However, there is no guarantee that increasing 
market share (firm A in Figure 7.6) will experience profitability. Furthermore, it 
is not possible to predict ahead of time which firm will attain  market share domi-
nance. If a product or a company or a technology—one of many competing in a 
market—gets ahead by quality of offering or clever  strategy, increasing returns 
can magnify this advantage, and the product or company or technology can go 
on to lock in the market. Microsoft DOS became dominant after a protracted 
battle with CPM and Apple for PC  operating system leadership.
Many new firms may enter a new industry with the potential to eventu-
ally dominate, but only one or two survive. Products do not stand alone but 
depend on complementary products to make their use valuable. Examples of 
network industries that exhibit increasing returns are airlines and banking. As 
an airline expands the number of cities it serves, the value to a customer of 
using the airline increases. Another prominent example is eBay, which has 
dominant market share in online auctions. Because it was the first to con-
nect individual buyers and sellers over the Internet in an auctionlike format, 
it grew very quickly. As more rare items came up for auction on eBay, more 
buyers were attracted to the website to bid on those items. Those extra bidders 
attracted still more sellers, thus  leading to dominance. Note that eBay was 
profitable from the first year onward.
While Metcalfe’s law illustrates the general idea of the value of a network, 
it is only an approximation to reality. The value of each node (participant) will 
vary. Furthermore, some links will be strong while others are weak. Custom-
ers value the number of nodes in the network but also key links in the network. 
A network of five nodes and eight links is shown in Figure 7.8. Note that not 
all nodes are connected by a link to all other nodes in this example. Con-
sider a bank network with 100 branches. Most people do not visit many other 
branches except their local branch and perhaps one near their work. For many 
customers, the link to their account at their local branch and online or via tele-
phone is what they value. Thus, designers of a network business must analyze 
their customers’ needs and build their business on the best information.
Consider Southwest Airlines. It has no physical branches, nor does it use 
travel agents; instead it uses telephone and online links to its network. It offers 
strong incentives to its customers to use the online rather than the telephone 
links. Physical branches may be necessary for banks but not for airlines. Wells 
Fargo is putting minibranches in grocery stores on the theory that its customers 
value physical nodes (branches) as well as Internet links.

In general, knowledge-based products exhibit increasing returns. The up-
front development costs are high, but the per-unit production costs thereafter are 
low. Knowledge-based products also exhibit network effects; that is, the more 
 people who use these products, the more valuable they become. 
Network Effects at Facebook
During the early 2000s, numerous social networking sites competed 
for users. Mark Zuckerberg, then a sophomore at Harvard University, 
launched “The Facebook” in 2004. It was intended to allow students in the 
same class to find one another and study together. Within one month, more 
than half of Harvard undergraduates had registered for the service. At first, 
only Harvard students were allowed access. Gradually, the site expanded, 
extending membership to other colleges in the Ivy League. The site was 
then opened to all university and high school students. In September 2006, 
Facebook was opened to all users.

7.5   Managing Risk 157
7.4 Risk versus Return
Reaching for higher returns carries higher risk. Assuming the entrepreneurs and 
their investors are rational beings, they will demand higher potential annual 
returns for higher-risk ventures. We illustrate a risk-reward model in Figure 7.9. 
The expected return varies as
 ER 5 R
f 1 R (7.7)
where ER 5 expected return, Rf 5 risk-free rate of return (T-bill), and R 5 risk. 
High-risk and high-return investments will be expected to return in excess of 
30 percent annualized over a period of years, T. For a high-risk venture, T may 
range from three to seven years [Ross et al., 2002]. A disruptive application or 
radical innovation is expected to return in excess of 40 percent annualized over 
T years (point a in Figure 7.9).
Compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) are an energy-efficient replacement 
for traditional incandescent bulbs. They use up to 75 percent less power than 
incandescent lights and could be the replacement for most home uses. Ellis 
Yan, a native of China, came to the United States and recognized the opportu-
nity presented by CFLs. He took a risk by making the bulbs when CFLs were 
largely ignored by large manufacturers and others in the market. CFLs are 
now seen as the climate-friendly solution for traditional lighting. By 2011, his 
company, TCP Inc. in Ohio, captured over half the U.S. market and generated 
revenue of almost $300 million dollars for a large return on his investment. 
Often, a more moderate return and risk venture (point b in Figure 7.9) can be 
achieved by using an incremental technology change rather than a disruptive 
technology in combination with a change in the business model. A moderate 
change in technology plus a moderate change in business model can lead to an 
attractive risk-return profile [Treacy, 2004].
Since then, it has become the most popular social networking site 
on the Internet. As of 2013, Facebook had more than 1 billion users. 
Of people aged 18-29, 92 percent have a social network account and 
89  percent of those people have Facebook accounts, according to Pew 
Research Center. It claims that 85 percent of U.S. undergraduate students 
are registered. Facebook, Orkut, and Friendster are competing for domi-
nance in the social networking market around the globe. Which of these 
three companies do you expect to reap the benefits of network effects?  
7.5 Managing Risk
New technologies and innovations create serious challenges for an existing firm. 
Change creates risks for competitors and a firm needs to manage risk. Business 
risk is growing in intensity and leaders of new ventures need to manage strate-
gic risk: the possibility of loss due to hazards, operating risks, and competitive

challenges. Managing risk requires anticipating threats and reversing them 
[Slywotzky, 2007]. Risk and reward can be decoupled if a firm learns how to 
manage risk. Defeating risk is based on a keen knowledge of the customer, a 
unique value proposition, and a winning profit model. 
As industrial and technological change occurs, a well-managed enterprise 
is ready to quickly adapt to any challenge. Firms can manage risk by constantly 
asking about potential challenges to product, brand, and business model. Video-
rental store Blockbuster failed to manage risk and lost to a new business model 
introduced by Netflix. Motorola, Nokia, and Blackberry lost significant cell 
phone/smart phone market share beginning in 2007 when Apple introduced its 
iPhones. The superior design, intuitive interfaces, and embedded technologies 
such as cameras caused users who were less price sensitive to migrate rapidly 
to the Apple iPhone. Ford and General Motors experienced great risk to their 
business design when Toyota introduced a hybrid auto called Prius. The Prius 
offers energy efficiency and a high-tech brand that eclipses the inefficiencies of 
traditional Fords and GMs.
During an economic recession, a heightened sense of risk of capital exists.  
However, a new venture’s success is sensitive to risks other than an economic 
downturn. The key factors for a start-up are the management quality of the

founders and their earlier experience in the industry, as well as the timeliness of 
the new technology innovation. It is difficult to find investors during a recession, 
but they are available. Great entrepreneurs persevere by creating a frugal plan 
for attracting new customers with reasonably priced products.
Ultimately, innovations are the core element for the future success of a new 
venture in any economic conditions. Innovations can occur in times of capital 
market anxieties when resources are limited, as well as during good times and 
financial exuberance. In fact, for many entrepreneurs with a good innovation, 
the time to act is during difficult economic times [Graham, 2008].
Principle 7
The entrepreneur seeks to manage risks and attain economies of scale, 
scope, and networks while achieving scalability of the business.
7.6 Spotlight on Dropbox
MIT graduates Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowski founded Dropbox, Inc. in 
2009. Dropbox is a cloud storage service that enables users to store photos, vid-
eos and documents. Dropbox is based on the “freemium” concept: Although the 
basic service is free, many subscribers pay a fee to upgrade to a premium service 
that provides more storage and other features. Thus, we can describe the busi-
ness model of Dropbox as high-growth company that attracts “free” users and 
later converts them to paid services. 
Dropbox has grown rapidly as existing users encourage new users to sub-
scribe. In turn, as more and more users join Dropbox, the value of the service 
grows since there are more opportunities for sharing. Dropbox thus exhibits 
economies of scale and increasing returns. At the same time, by scaling the 
Dropbox service and infrastructure with demand, the Dropbox team has been 
able to effectively manage risk. By 2013, Dropbox had 50 million users and 
revenue of about $300 million.
7.7 Summary
A new venture is subject to risks due to uncertainty of outcomes in the market-
place. It is the entrepreneur’s job to manage and reduce all risks. As ventures 
grow, they may experience economies of scale and scope, resulting in lower 
costs per unit produced. Furthermore, attractive ventures are those that can read-
ily expand their capacity in response to demand and are said to be readily scal-
able. Many industries operate in a network of participants and exhibit network 
economies. As some network industries move toward an industry standard, a 
few firms may experience increasing returns. Significant value can be added to a 
product when a creative design leads to the embodiment of critical details.

 CHAPTER 8
Creativity and Product Development
Knowledge and human power are synonymous, since the ignorance of the 
cause frustrates the effect.
Francis Bacon
How can an organization establish an environ-
ment that fosters bringing new products and 
services to market on a consistent and timely 
basis?
O
ver the past 20 years, product life cycles 
have gotten shorter and shorter—in large 
part due to faster technological break-
throughs. To keep pace with this environment of 
rapid change, companies must establish a creative 
environment that strongly encourages spend-
ing time on new ideas, concepts, and solutions. 
The creative enterprise is based on six resources, 
which are outlined in Table 8.1. Creative ideas, 
concepts, and solutions are turned into prod-
ucts and  services through the product design and 
development  process. This process is concerned 
with the  concrete details that embody a new prod-
uct or service. Prototypes are models of a product 
or service and can help a new technology venture 
to learn about the right form of the product for the 
customer. Scenarios are used to create a mental 
model of a possible sequence of future events or 
outcomes. Good product development relies on 
the five practices listed in Table 8.5.

CHAPTER 8   Creativity and Product Development164
Creativity is the ability to use the imagination to develop new ideas, new 
things, or new solutions. Creative thinking is a core competency of most new 
ventures, and entrepreneurs strive to have creative people on their team. Creative 
ideas often arise when creative people look at established solutions, practices, 
or products and think of something new or different. These creative ideas can 
underlie invention, and invention can flow to innovation. Thus, firms committed 
to innovation must fundamentally strive to encourage and support creativity.
The creative enterprise is based on six resources as shown in Table 8.1 
[Sternberg et al., 1997]. To create something new, one needs knowledge of 
the field and of the domain of knowledge required. Domains are areas such 
as science, engineering, or marketing. Fields within a domain might be circuit 
design or market research. 
The intellectual ability required is the ability to see linkages between things, 
redefine problems, and envision and analyze possible practical solutions.  Creative 
people use inventive thinking that reflects in novel ways on a problem. A creative 
thinker is motivated to make something happen and is open to change. Finally, 
the creative person understands the context of the problem and is willing to take a 
reasonable risk. The person who has most of these skills is often called intuitive; 
that is, he or she has an instinctive ability to perceive or learn relationships, ideas, 
and solutions.
One process of creative thinking is shown in Figure 8.1. It starts with a 
description of a problem and rests for a period of incubation. Then, intuitive 
brainstorming leads to good insights and ideas that can be evaluated and tested. 
Finally, a prototype is built and shown to the potential customer. This process 
may lead the entrepreneur to revise the question or problem and to begin a second 
cycle through the process. The entrepreneur continues around the loop until the 
prototype product solves the problem. 
It is also useful to think of the innovation process as involving multiple 
personas, each with their own skills and points of view. The first three personas 
occupy learning roles: the anthropologist observes behaviors and develops a deep 
understanding of how people interact with products, services, and each other; 
the experimenter prototypes new ideas continuously; and the cross-pollinator

fields: and knowing what is new.

 connections, redefine problems, and

ideas and solutions.

 ■ Motivation toward action.
 ■ Opportunity-oriented personality and 
openness to change.
■ Contextual understanding that supports 
creativity and mitigates risks.

explores other industries and settings and borrows relevant ideas from them. 
The next three personas occupy organizing roles: the hurdler develops a knack 
for overcoming and outsmarting potential obstacles; the collaborator helps 
to bring diverse groups together; and the director gathers and inspires the 
team. The last four personas occupy building roles: the experience architect 
designs compelling experiences that go beyond mere functionality; the set 
designer transforms physical environments to facilitate the work of innovative 
team members; the caregiver anticipates and attends to customer needs; and 
the storyteller conveys a compelling narrative about the project [Kelley and 
Littman, 2005].
Figure 8.2 illustrates the “Innovation Engine,” which shows how different 
internal and external factors can work together to enhance creativity. The three 
factors on the inside of the Innovation Engine are knowledge, imagination and 
attitude. Knowledge provides the fuel for one’s imagination. Imagination, in 
turn, is the catalyst for transforming knowledge into new ideas. Finally, attitude 
sets the Innovation Engine in motion. The three factors on the outside of the 
Innovation Engine are resources, habitats, and culture. Resources include the 
assets in an entrepreneur’s community. Habitat is the physical space, constraints, 
incentives and team dynamics that surround the entrepreneur. Finally, culture 
refers to collective beliefs, values and behaviors in the entrepreneur’s community 
[Seelig, 2012].

FIGURE 8.2 Innovation Engine. 
An entrepreneur can improve all six factors to increase innovation. 
Imagination can be enhanced by reframing problems, connecting ideas, and 
challenging assumptions [Seelig, 2012]. For example, in 1954, Kay Zufall was 
looking for new things for children to do. She did not like the modeling clay 
sold for children because it was too stiff. However, her brother-in-law made a 
doughy mixture for cleaning wallpaper. Zufall tried it as a modeling medium and 
discovered it was soft and easy to mold and cut up. She and her brother-in-law 
reformulated it as a safe and colorful product for children, and they came up with 
the name: PlayDoh [Sutton, 2002].
A powerful method for enhancing the imagination is brainstorming. In 
a brainstorming session, diverse people come together to generate new ideas 
through conversation and interaction. Brainstorming sessions typically require 
significant planning, setup and follow-through. Table 8.2 lists eight guidelines for 
effective brainstorming sessions.
The mindset of the brainstorming group is particularly important. To 
be effective, teams should follow certain brainstorming “rules,” as listed in 
Table 8.3. Entrepreneurs can be naturally inclined to judge ideas immediately, 
leading them to filter the ideas that they discuss and record in a brainstorming 
session. The point of a brainstorming session, however, is to stir the imagination 
in order to generate new ideas. Some firms, like the product-design firm IDEO, 
post printouts of the brainstorming rules in Table 8.3 in their work environments 
to remind team members of this goal.
Entrepreneurs also can act to enhance parts of the Innovation Engine 
beyond imagination. For example, an entrepreneur can enhance her knowledge 
of a market by engaging deeply with potential customers through conversations 
and observations. Entrepreneurs also can work to apply their knowledge across 
different domains. For example, Tina Seelig completed her PhD in neuroscience 
at the Stanford University School of Medicine. Soon after she completed her 
degree, she decided that she wanted to enter the world of business. She realized 
that her ability to do scientific research was directly applicable to the kinds of 
problems that she would face in the business world.  Even though Seelig did not

have a degree in business, she did have highly relevant knowledge. Being able to 
tap into your knowledge and apply it in different settings is a powerful tool for 
creative problem solving.
An important part of attitude lies in maintaining a willingness to 
experiment and the drive to push through challenges to solve problems. 
Research shows that the human mind is malleable and that people who 
maintain a positive and learning-oriented attitude have different brain activity 
than people who do not. 
TABLE 8.2 Guidelines for effective brainstorming sessions.
Right people A brainstorming group should be diverse, relatively small, and 
free of internal politics
Right challenge A brainstorming group should focus on a clearly-stated 
challenge
Right mindset A brainstorming group should adopt a creative and generative 
mindset, not a critical and evaluative one
Right empathy A brainstorming group should focus on understanding the 
 people who are affected by the challenge
Right stimulus A brainstorming group should use questions that question 
assumptions, consider extreme cases, employ analogies, and 
explore technology scenarios and trends
Right facilitation A brainstorming group should ensure that everyone participates, 
while keeping the conversation fresh and energetic
Right follow-up A brainstorming group should have some way to ensure 
that ideas can later be considered and, where appropriate, 
implemented

excels, with idea evaluation
Capture all ideas Even ideas that seem irrelevant or “bad” can be the basis

Be visual Use pictures and diagrams, not just words, to capture 
ideas

Finally, habitat plays an important role in facilitating creativity. Part of habitat 
is the physical environment itself. Many startups feature brightly-colored and 
open spaces with easily-movable furniture, whiteboards, and even games. These 
physical environments support creativity by encouraging informal interactions 
and by providing an easy way to capture insights.
Habitat also includes incentives and team dynamics. All firms need a culture 
that sustains a creative process that enables team members to engage and interact 
with new solutions. The leaders of a new venture can play a particularly important 
role in establishing this culture; firms with leaders who empower employees 
experience greater creativity [Zhang and Bartol, 2010]. Leaders also should work 
to establish a collaborative culture around creativity. Collaborative teams are 
more likely to achieve creative breakthroughs, since they can draw upon multiple 
perspectives, and are less likely to have very poor outcomes, since groups 
typically have a more rigorous selection process [Singh and Fleming, 2010]. 
Entrepreneurial leaders influence the culture by putting in place rules, 
rewards, and incentives that can foster innovation. Even those employees not 
in a leadership role with direct control over the corporate culture can indirectly 
influence the culture by reinforcing other parts of the Innovation Engine. For 
example, by increasing their imagination, they create opportunities for the 
organization that can ultimately impact that entire organizational culture.  
Table 8.4 conveys several ideas for managing a creative work environment. 
These ideas can clash, however, with conventional management practices 
[Sutton,  2002]. A natural conflict exists between managing for creativity or 
exploration on one hand and implementation or exploitation on the other hand: 
new ideas and inventions depend upon creativity; bringing these inventions to 
market, however, may require routine processes [Freeman and Engel, 2007]. 
A small, emerging firm can accommodate both tendencies within it. As a firm 
grows, it needs to build a culture that reinforces the best qualities of creativity as 
well as efficient execution of its business processes [Brown, 2001].

8.2 Product Design and Development
One of the early tasks of a new venture is the design and development of the new 
product. The entrepreneurial team wants to develop a new product or service that 
can establish a leadership position. One of the strengths of a new venture is that the 
leadership of the venture plays a central role in all stages of the development effort. 
Furthermore, the small new firm is able to integrate the specialized capabilities 
necessary for the development of a successful product [Burgelman, 2002].
In recent years, product complexity has dramatically increased. As products 
acquire more functions, the difficulty of forecasting product requirements rises 
exponentially. Furthermore, the rate of change in most markets is also increasing, 
thereby reducing the effectiveness of traditional approaches to forecasting future 
product requirements. As a result, entrepreneurs need to redefine the problem from 
one of improving forecasting to one of eliminating the need for accurate long-
term forecasts. Thus, many product designers attempt to retain flexibility of the 
product characteristics as the development proceeds. A design and development 
project can be said to be flexible to the extent that the cost of any change is low. 
Then, project leaders can make product design choices that allow the product to 
easily accommodate change [Thompke and Reinertsen, 1998]. Uncertainty is an 
inevitable aspect of all design and development projects, and most entrepreneurs 
have difficulty controlling it. The  challenge is to find the right balance between 
planning and learning. Planning provides discipline, and learning provides 
flexibility and adaptation. Openness to learning is necessary for most new ventures 
that are finding their way into the market [DeMeyer et al., 2002].
Design of a product leads to the arrangement of concrete details that 
embodies a new product idea or concept. The design process is the organization 
and management of people, concepts, and information utilized in the development 
of the form and function of a product. The role of design is, in part, to mediate 
between the novel concept and the established institutional needs. For example, 
Thomas Edison designed and described the electric light in terms of the 
bye23429_ch08_163-182.indd   169bye23429_ch08_163-182.indd   169 12/11/13   9:49 AM12/11/13   9:49 AM

established institutions and culture. As a result, he succeeded in developing an 
electric lighting system that gained rapid acceptance as an alternate to the gas 
lamp. A new product needs to be advanced, yet it should not deprive the user 
of the familiar features necessary for understanding and using the product. As 
new products are designed, the challenge ultimately lies in finding familiar cues 
that locate and describe new ideas without binding users too closely to the old 
ways of doing things. Entrepreneurs must find the balance between novelty and 
familiarity, between impact and acceptance [Hargadon and Douglas, 2001]. 
Tony Fadell is a prototypical breakthrough thinker. While at Apple, he 
thought of the concept of a small portable digital music player, which later 
became the iPod. He then went on to be a key player in the development 
of the iPhone, which catapulted Apple to its current position as one of 
the world’s highest valued firms. Tony looks at products and then 
reenvisions how these products might be made easier to use or more 
accessible. Fadell followed up his work at Apple by creating the Nest 
Learning Thermostat. The idea for a smart thermostat came to him  while 
shopping for thermostats for an energy-efficient home he was building. At 
the time, Fadell realized that the state of at-home and office thermostats 
seemed to be caught in a time warp. These devices had few features and 
limited intelligence. With this knowledge, he reimagined an easy-to-use 
thermostat that could be controlled both manually and over the internet. 
His invention is upending what had been a stagnant market for decades. 
Nest is now vying to replace the 250 million thermostats in homes, office 
buildings, stores, and restaurants.
Tony Fadell: Thermostat Breakthrough
Good, effective products or services are the outcome of a methodology 
based on solid, proven design principles [Brown, 2008]. Innovation is 
powered by a thorough understanding of how people want products made, 
packaged, marketed, sold, and supported. The overall development process 
is shown in Figure 8.3 [Thompke and Von Hippel, 2002]. The overall 
development process can include design of the product and its architecture, 
its physical design, and testing. The iPad and the Tesla Roadster sports car 
are examples of the outcome of a creative, artistic process of design. Part 
of the user experience is the look and feel of a product. A good product is 
attractive to see and easy to use and understand. Furthermore, customers 
want a product that does a few things really well. Fortunately, customers can 
participate fruitfully in the product design process when the innovations are 
incremental [Nambisan, 2002]. Good designers think about the qualities of 
a product as well as its soft benefits such as warmth, status, and community.
Design includes aesthetics as well as basic needs. A beautiful glass must be 
functional as well as attractive. However, design also includes compromises and

limits. Even the Maglite flashlight, which is widely acknowledged for its good 
design, is flawed by the spot in the middle of the light beam.
Successful product design and development requires commitment, vision, 
improvisation, information exchange, and collaboration, as listed in Table 8.5 
[Lynn and Reilly, 2002]. These five practices may be easy to achieve in a start-up 
where collaboration is the order of the day. The product team, which may be 
all of the employees of a start-up, needs to clearly understand the vision for the 
product and work together effectively.
The product design process [step 2 in Figure 8.3] is shown in Figure 8.4. 
The first step is to establish the goals and attributes of the product expressed 
as the required performance and robustness of the product (step A). When 
possible, the potential customer should be included in the design process.

The voice of the customer can communicate the insights needed for the best 
products [Lojacono and Zacoai, 2004]. Potential customers can suggest ideas 
for new products and can be involved throughout the product development 
process to provide continuous feedback [Ogawa and Piller,  2006]. Firms

may also find that observing potential customers, rather than simply 
surveying or interviewing them, can yield important information about their 
product needs. 
In step B of Figure 8.4, the components and parameters available for 
adjustment are identified, and specifications for the product are agreed upon. 
Specifications are the precise description of what the product has to do. In 
addition, the set of physical and social constraints should be determined. Next, 
the product configuration is established, and the components of the product 
are recorded. Finally, the parameters of the product are optimized to achieve 
the best performance and robustness at a reasonable cost [Ullman, 2003]. 
A robust product is one that is relatively insensitive to aging, deterioration, 
component variations, and environmental conditions. Preparing a robust design 
implies minimizing variation in performance and quality. All designs involve 
trade-offs between performance, cost, physical factors, and other constraints 
[Petroski, 2003]. The success or failure of any design is ultimately determined 
in the marketplace.
Usability is a measure of the quality of a user’s experience when interacting 
with a product. Usability is a combination of the five factors listed in Table 8.6. 
Examples of a common product with poor usability are most DVR and DVD 
players. New products should pass the five-minute test, which requires that the 
product is simple enough to use after quickly reading the instructions and then 
trying it for a few minutes. Information technology products with excellent 
 usability are the iPhone, Skype, Twitter, Gmail, and Wikipedia.
Many system designs use a combination of modules within a specified 
architecture. A module is an independent interchangeable unit that can be 
combined with others to form a larger system. In modular designs, changing one 
component has little influence on the performance of others or on the system as 
a whole. An example is the iPod, which Apple’s engineers first developed from 
a wide range of standard, interchangeable parts and modules. Design methods 
using independent modules make product design more predictable. Of course, the 
predictability inherent in modular design increases the chances that competitors 
can develop similar products.
Realistically, most products consist of modules that possess some depen-
dency between them. For example, an automobile is a product that consists of 
TABLE 8.6 Five factors of usability.
1.  Ease of learning: How long does it take to learn the product’s operation?
2.  Efficiency of use: Once experienced, how fast can the user complete the
  necessary steps?
3.  Memorability: Can the user remember how to use the product?
4.  Error frequency and How often do users make errors, and how serious are
 severity:  these errors?
5.  Satisfaction: Does the user like operating the product?

CHAPTER 8   Creativity and Product Development174
wheels, engine, body, and controls that are relatively interdependent. Products 
made up of modules with intermediate levels of interdependence are harder for 
competitors to duplicate and may also provide better performance than a design 
based on purely independent modules [Fleming and Sorenson, 2001].
Designers strive to create new products different enough to attract interest 
but close enough to current products to be feasible to make a market. Many new 
designs flow from changing the components, attributes, or integration scheme to 
create a new product [Goldenberg et al., 2003]. The designer asks what can be 
rearranged, removed, or replicated in new ways.
Over time a dominant design in a product class wins the allegiance of the 
marketplace. A dominant design is a single architecture that establishes domi-
nance in a product class. An example is the Microsoft Windows operating 
system, used in the vast majority of personal computers. Eventually, a dominant 
design becomes embedded in linkages to other systems. For example, the use 
of Windows shapes hardware interfaces and the other software programs that 
computers can run. 
A product platform is a set of modules and interfaces that forms a 
common architecture from which a stream of derivative products can be 
efficiently developed and produced. For example, Google’s Android and 
Apple’s iPhone seek to be the leading platform for smartphone applications. 
Firms target new platforms to meet the needs of a core group of customers 
but design them for ready modification into derivative products through the 
addition, substitution, or removal of features. Well-designed platforms also 
provide a smooth migration path between generations so neither the customer 
nor the distribution channel is disrupted. A good example of a platform is 
Hewlett-Packard’s electronics and software used for its printers; although 
Hewlett-Packard offers a wide range of printers, these products draw upon 
relatively similar electronics and software.
8.3 Product Prototypes
Whenever possible, new business ventures should create a prototype of their 
product. A prototype is a physical model of a proposed product or service that 
conveys the essential features but remains open to modification. Prototypes can 
be used to identify and test requirements for the product by eliciting comments 
from designers, users, and others. New ventures can use prototypes to redefine 
their business models and strategies. 
Prototypes can be pictures, sketches, mock-ups, or diagrams that can 
be collaboratively studied. They also can be physical, digital, pictorial, or 
some combination of media. The computer software industry uses prototypes 
called beta versions of software to elicit response from lead customers. For 
example, Microsoft made a beta version of Windows 8 available as a free 
download. Microsoft then used customer feedback to refine the product for its 
official release.

8.3   Product Prototypes 175
In the creation of a movie or play, many innovators use sketches, 
storyboards, and videos to describe the product. The designers of a movie 
or play want to see how it works and engage in a collaborative redesign. The 
iterative procedure for prototype development is shown in Figure 8.5. Two 
or three iterations of the process may be sufficient to arrive at a satisfactory 
prototype.
New technologies such as computer simulations can make the creation of 
a prototype fast and cheap. Rapid prototyping is the fast development of a 
useful prototype that can be used for collaborative review and modification. An 
initial prototype can be rough since it enables the team to view the product and 
improve it. The ability to see and manipulate high-quality computer images helps 
create innovative designs. BMW uses computers to help engineers  visualize 
automobile design and the results of crash tests [Thompke, 2001]. Personal 
fabrication systems, clusters of tools and software that function as complete job 
shops, are available [Gershenfeld, 2005].
Product-development firm IDEO believes that prototypes should be 
“rough, ready, right.” While working with Gyrus ENT to develop a better sinus-
surgery tool, IDEO employees demonstrated the value of having a prototype to 
show customers. During one discussion, 10 surgeons struggled to explain the 
discomfort involved in using the existing tool. An IDEO manager picked up a 
film canister, a white-board marker, and a clothespin and taped them together 
as a prototype. The physical prototype helped to move the conversation along, 
allowing the surgeons to hold and adjust it. The rough prototype was just that—
rough and unfinished—encouraging the surgeons to modify and tinker with it. 
Creating a rough prototype allowed customers to engage in the development of 
the product, and to enthusiastically adopt it in surgery. Eventually, IDEO and 
Gyrus produced a tool that is used in over 300,000 procedures in the United 
States every year.
It is often best to carry multiple product concepts into the prototyping 
phase and to select the best of those designs later in the process [Dahan and 
Srinivasan, 2000]. Keeping multiple product concept options open and freezing 
the concept late in the development process affords the flexibility to respond to 
market and technology shifts. It is possible to create static and dynamic virtual 
prototypes that are displayed at a website for review and testing by suppliers, 
customers, and designers. Virtual prototypes cost considerably less to build and 
Henry Ford planned to build a horseless carriage. However, no one could 
be persuaded to invest in it. A key turning point came when Ford built a 
prototype car for the Grosse Pointe automobile races. Ford entered the 
races, drove the car himself, and won decisively. He repeated the feat 
the following year in 1902. The victory attracted investors, and the Ford 
Motor Company was up and running.

test than their physical counterparts, so design teams using Internet-based product 
research can afford to explore a much larger number of concepts. Furthermore, 
Internet-based prototypes can help to reduce the uncertainty in a new product 
introduction by allowing more ideas to be tested in parallel.
SaltAire Sinus Relief provides a nose wash to relieve the symptoms of 
sinusitis and allergies (see www.saltairesinuswash.com). A bottle and pump 
are used to spray a supersalty solution into the sinus chamber and relieve the 
symptoms [Ridgway, 2003]. Two New York physicians founded the firm in 1997 
and created a series of prototypes for people to try. Based on that knowledge, 
they showed a revised product to other physicians and launched the product 
in 2000. The patented dispenser bottle the firm developed won an award for 
innovative design.
For the innovator, a prototype is a mechanism for teaching the market about 
the technology and for learning from the market how valuable that technology 
is in that application arena. Uses for robots in situations too dangerous for

people have long been imagined. Many robotics companies tried and failed 
to create robots that could successfully enter and explore disaster zones and 
other dangerous environments. For example iRobot first demonstrated a 
prototype of the Urbie robot in 1997. This was the first commercially available 
robot that was able to climb stairs. This prototype showed the market that 
iRobot’s products had overcome many of the fundamental limitations of other 
contemporary robots. By 2013, iRobot’s revenue was over $430 million, and its 
products were available in over 7,000 retail outlets. Robots like the Urbie were 
used to explore the rubble of the World Trade Center, and have been used by 
the military to explore situations that would be extremely dangerous for troops. 
Over three million units of the Roomba, the consumer version of the Urbie, 
have been sold. The Roomba uses similar technology as the Urbie to sweep and 
vacuum floors.
Many firms have developed their products by entering potential markets 
with early versions of the products, learning from the tests, and probing again. 
These firms ran a series of market experiments, which introduced prototypes 
into a variety of market segments. The initial product design was not the 
culmination of the development process but rather the first step, and the first 
step in the development process was in and of itself less important than the 
learning and the subsequent, better-informed steps that followed. Software 
products lend themselves to rapid prototyping and early tests with potential 
customers.
8.4 Scenarios
Any new venture can benefit from creating a set of scenarios to address complex, 
uncertain challenges as it develops its strategy. A scenario is an imagined 
sequence of possible events or outcomes, sometimes called a mental model. 
A few realistic scenarios based on the industrial context and a few associated 
possible sequences of events help a planner to plan for the future. Each 
scenario tells a story of how the various elements might interact under a variety 
of assumptions. It paints vivid narratives of the future. The goal of scenario 
planning is not to forecast what is going to happen but to encourage an openness 
of mind, a flexibility of response, and a habit of questioning conventional 
wisdom. As Stephen Covey and A. R. Merrill [1996] stated: “The best way to 
predict your future is to create it.”
Scenarios lead to learning in a two-step process: constructing a scenario and 
using the content of the scenario to learn [Fahey and Randall, 1998]. The key 
elements of a scenario are shown in Figure 8.6. A scenario attempts to answer 
key questions and is based on a statement of the driving forces and the rationale 
for the story. The outcomes or results of the story lead to understanding and a 
useful decision. A scenario is an internally consistent picture of what the future 
might bring. It is not a forecast, but rather one possible outcome. Creating four or 
five scenarios will help portray the range of potential outcomes to core questions 
facing any organization.

Entrepreneurs will often weigh whether a new technology will be radical or 
nonlinear and have a profound impact on the marketplace. A scenario can help 
define the impact and time frame for a new technology.
An example of the outline of a scenario for the growth of electric auto sales is 
shown in Figure 8.7. The structure of the story for electric vehicles can be used to 
build several possible scenarios that can be used to learn about the opportunities 
in this market.
Scenarios can sometimes become a mirage. By 2001, the futurists—George 
Gilder and others—had created a scenario for the future of telecommunications 
that was overblown and ill-timed. This rosy, nirvana-like scenario missed the 
regulatory issues and the concept of excess capacity. Scenarios often can be too 
rosy [Malik, 2003].

CHAPTER 8   Creativity and Product Development180
8.6 Summary
Creative thinking is a core competency of most new ventures. Entrepreneurs 
should design their organizations and engage in practices to encourage creativ-
ity. Product design and development builds upon creativity, turning ideas, con-
cepts and solutions into new products or services.
Prototypes are models of a product or service and can help a new venture 
learn the right form and function of a product by showing it to customers and 
letting them observe it or try it. Furthermore, scenarios can be used to examine 
possible future outcomes based on specific actions.
Principle 8
Knowledge acquired, shared, and used is a powerful tool for the entre-
preneur to build a learning organization that can design innovative 
products and grow effectively.

arketing and sales are critical to the 
 success of a new firm since the firm 
normally starts without any  customers. 
A new business must create a marketing and 
sales plan, which describes its target customers 
for its product offering. The plan should include 
a  product position and a mix of price, product, 
 promotion, and distribution channels that will 
 attract and satisfy the customer. Gaining recogni-
tion and acceptance in a target market requires the 
following steps in sequence:
■ Describe the product offering
■ Describe the target customer
■ State the marketing objectives
■ Gather information through market research
■ Create a marketing plan
■ Create a sales plan
■ Build a marketing and sales staff

CHAPTER 9   Marketing and Sales184
9.1 Marketing
Marketing is a set of activities with the objective of securing, serving, and 
retaining customers for the firm’s product offerings. Marketing is getting the 
right message to the right customer segment via the appropriate media and meth-
ods. It is the task of the marketing function to help create the product and the 
terms of its offering as well as communicate its value to the customers. Ideally, 
marketing “merges the minds” of customers and product developers, facilitating 
the identification of unspoken but important needs [Lassiter, 2002].
The purpose of the marketing plan is to describe the steps required to 
achieve the marketing objective. The marketing plan is a written document serv-
ing as a section of a new venture’s business plan and contains action steps for the 
marketing program for the products. Peter Drucker [2002] has said, “Because its 
purpose is to create a customer, the business has two basic functions: marketing 
and innovation. Marketing and innovation produce results; all the rest are costs.”
In Chapter 3, we described the creation of a value proposition and business 
model for the identified customer. In Chapters 4 and 5, we described the ele-
ments of an overall business strategy and market analysis. Given these business 
elements, we need to develop a marketing strategy and build a marketing plan. 
The six elements of a marketing plan are shown in Table 9.1.
The first element of the marketing plan is a clear statement of objectives. 
The second element is the identification of one or more customer target seg-
ments. The goal of target segments is to carefully select the appropriate custom-
ers and to focus the marketing activities on those segments. The third element is 
the description of the product and the terms and conditions of its formal offering. 
Given our knowledge of the product and its offering, we need to determine what 
the response of the customer might be and how we can develop a strategy to 
attract and retain the customer. Next, we describe the marketing mix consisting 
of price, product, promotion, and place (channels). Finally, we describe plans for 
relating to our customer in the sales and  service activities.
The marketing plan will be implemented through a marketing program. 
The plan will describe how we will take the product to market and attract, 
serve, and retain satisfied customers. The marketing and sales activity is por-
trayed in Figure 9.1. The new venture communicates information about its

product and how it sells and services the product for the customer. When the 
customers  purchase the product, they provide some useful information about the 
purchase and the use of the product for the seller.
The marketing and sales plan will flow from the opportunity and the busi-
ness model, as shown in Figure 9.2.
9.2   Marketing Objectives and Customer 
Target Segments
The marketing objectives statement is a clear description of the key objectives 
of the marketing program. Objectives may include sales goals, market share, 
profitability, regional plans, and customer acquisition goals. Objectives should 
be quantified and given for a time period, such as “the firm will sell 1,000 units 
in the initial sales phase in Texas and Oklahoma in the first year of activity.”
A clear understanding of who the customers are and why they will buy is 
critical. Selected markets or groups of customers are often called customer target 
segments. A market segment consists of a group with similar needs or wants 
who reference each other and may include geographical location, purchasing 
power, and buying attitudes. Market segmentation divides markets into seg-
ments that have different buying needs, wants, and habits. Different segments 
will require different marketing strategies. For example, a business based on 
Internet sales should know that different age groups, which are one type of 
segment, vary dramatically in their propensity to shop and in the amount they 
spend [Abate, 2008]. Often a new venture identifies one target segment for its 
initial marketing effort, carefully describing the customer in that segment in 
terms of geographic, demographic, psychographic, and other variables [Winer, 
2000]. Geographic variables include city, region, and type, such as “urban.” 
 Demographic variables include age, gender, income, education, religion, and 
social class. Psychographic variables include lifestyle and personality variables 
that influence a customer’s wants and needs. Good segmentations identify the 
groups most worth pursuing and they tell companies what products to sell to 
these groups. Good segmentations also change over time, along with customers 
[Yankelovich and Meer, 2006].

CHAPTER 9   Marketing and Sales186
The target segment for Samsung’s Galaxy phone can be described as young 
adults who crave a full-featured wireless device with cutting-edge technology.
With a clear description of the target customer, a new venture can devise a plan 
to attract and retain them. Marketing to a segment enables the new firm to nar-
row the marketing strategy and put all its effort into acquiring new customers in 
the target market. Often, new firms reach for too many market segments in their 
early efforts, thus  dissipating their resources before they can build up a  customer 
base. Table 9.2 identifies four critical questions to ask about target markets.
It is wise to figure out who will be your best customer and then pursue that 
segment. A best customer is one who values your brand, buys it regularly whether 
your product is on sale or not, tells his or her friends about your product, and will not 
readily switch to a competitor. Entrepreneurs identify their customer segment and 
position their product to serve them very well [Ettenberg, 2002].
InVision: The Right Product at the Right Time
InVision Technologies designs and manufactures electronic baggage 
screening systems (see www.invision-tech.com). InVision Technolo-
gies was founded in 1990 to provide airport security devices by using 
computed tomography to detect explosives. Its target segment, U.S. air-
port baggage screening, was slow growing before the terrorist attacks on 
 September 11, 2001. It sold 250 machines in the preceding decade but 750 
machines in the two years following the attacks. InVision also planned to 
enter the international market. InVision’s success and expertise led to its 
acquisition by GE in 2004 for $900 million.
Redefining Flexcar’s Customer Segments
Car sharing is aimed at people who want to use a car for a short time but 
do not need to own it. This scheme is particularly attractive in urban cen-
ters. In general, people are moving toward access rather than ownership of 
autos in dense urban areas with high auto costs. Neil Peterson started Flex-
car in 1999 in Seattle and then expanded to Los Angeles, San Francisco, 
Washington, D.C., and San Diego.
As the venture grew, the average cost of owning or leasing a new car 
became $625 a month. The average member in a car-sharing program spent 
less than $100 a month on car expenses. Flexcar initially identified its target 
segment as individu als. It soon discovered, however, that the biggest growth 
came not from individuals but from small and midsize companies that did not 
want to maintain their own fleets of vehicles [Stringer, 2003]. In 2007, Flexcar 
merged with Zipcar (see www.zipcar.com). In 2013, Avis acquired Zipcar for 
$500 million.

9.3   Product and Offering Description 187
9.3 Product and Offering Description
The product’s features and primary attributes are typically described early in a 
business plan. If possible, a product positioning map should be developed. All 
products can be differentiated to some extent by communicating the most highly 
valuable benefit to the buyer. Positioning is the act of designing the product 
offering and image to occupy a distinctive place in the target customer’s mind 
[Ries and Trout, 2001].
TABLE 9.2 Four crucial questions to ask about target markets.
■ Is there a target market segment where the company can enter the market and provide 
clear customer benefits at a price the customer is willing to pay?
■ Do customers perceive that these benefits are superior to other solutions/options?
■ How large is the target market segment and how fast is it growing?
■ Will entry into the target market segment serve as a springboard for entry into other 
segments?

Positioning of a product enables the firm to differentiate it in the mind of 
the prospect. Volvo connotes safety, and FedEx owns “overnight.” A product 
position ing map shows the product characteristics in relation to its competitors.  
Figure 9.3 shows the positioning of Instagram relative to other photo sharing 
applications. It would then be the task of the marketing effort to clearly commu-
nicate that position to the target customer.
Positioning a product focuses on a few key attributes of the value prop-
osition. A positioning statement, as shown in Figure 9.4, helps to define the 
 positioning of the product. Once we have a product position, we seek to build 
a powerful product offering [Moore, 2002]. A product offering communi-
cates the key values of the product and describes the benefits to the customer. 
The unique  selling proposition is a statement of the key customer benefit of a 
 product that differentiates it from its competition. The unique selling proposition 
for  Instagram could be:
 Instagram delivers an easy way to edit and share photos with your friends 
and family.
The unique selling proposition of FedEx is:
We deliver your packages overnight—guaranteed.

9.4   Brand Equity 189
9.4 Brand Equity
As discussed in Chapter 4, the new venture should have a competitive  advantage 
such as low cost, high quality, superior customer relationships, or increased 
performance. Many new technology ventures differentiate themselves from 
competitors by tying these product characteristics to their brand. A brand is a 
combination of name, sign, or symbol that identifies the goods sold by a firm. 
A brand accurately  identifies the seller to the buyer and resides in the minds of 
consumers. Well-known brands include Intel, Philips, Sony and Samsung.
Brand equity is the perceived worthiness of the brand in the mind of the 
customer and may be portrayed as the sum of four dimensions, as shown in 
Table 9.3 [Aaker and Joachimsthaler, 2000]. Brand awareness or familiarity 
is the first step in building a brand. The perceived quality of the product and 
respect for the product will help build brand equity. The quality of the product 
and its perceived vitality will build an image of the brand. A b rand associa-
tion is how the customer relates to the brand through personal and emotional 
associations. This dimension is present in the emotional relationship that Harley-
Davidson owners have with the motorcycle brand. In other words, brand loyalty 
responds to promises kept by the seller. Technology firms with significant brand 
equity include Apple, Canon, Facebook, GE, Google, and Intel.
A brand’s promise of value is the core element of differentiation. This 
promise of value is tied to the customer, and loyalty will follow from good cus-
tomer experiences. Many customers are willing to pay more for some badge of 
 identification—Apple’s logo, for example—that makes them feel they are part 
of a community. A strong corporate brand lets customers know what they can 
expect of the whole range of products that a company produces. The most suc-
cessful corporate brands are universal and facilitate differences of interpretation 
that appeal to different groups. This is particularly true of corporate brands whose 
symbolism is strong enough to allow people across cultures to share symbols 
even when they don’t share the same meaning. 
The brand of a company is customer centered and focuses on the product 
or service offered. By contrast, the reputation of a company focuses on the 
 credibility and respect among a broad set of constituencies such as suppliers, 
regulators, employees, the media, and the local communities. Brand equity 
depends on the delivery of a good product to customers. Reputation depends on 
the goodwill of communities and stakeholders [Ettenson and Knowles, 2008]. 
Both brand equity and reputation are important to a venture’s success.
TABLE 9.3 Four dimensions of brand equity.
■ Brand awareness or familiarity
■ Perceived quality and vitality of the product
■ Brand associations: connects the customer to the brand
■ Brand loyalty: a bond or tie to the product

Some brands, such as Nike, Harley-Davidson, and BMW, become icons 
[Holt, 2003]. A brand becomes an icon when it offers a compelling story that 
resonates with consumers. One of the most potent stories is the depiction of 
a group of rebels. For example, Harley-Davidson appeals to rebel motorcycle 
 enthusiasts who want to stand out as different from the crowd.
One approach to building a brand, therefore, is to identify the differentiat-
ing benefit that is important to the target customers and then to describe the 
attributes that imply this benefit. For example, Intel identifies superior quality as 
its benefit. Successive marketing campaigns have informed consumers that Intel 
integrated circuits have  reliable high perfor m ance and are leading-edge products 
promising superior  quality.
9.5 Marketing Mix
The four elements of the marketing mix are shown in Table 9.4. The  product 
is the item or service that serves the needs of the customer. The marketing plan 
describes the key methods of differentiating this product. Coca-Cola, for exam-
ple, differentiates regular Coke by using a distinctive trademarked bottle with 
ribbing. Shutterfly uses premium printing processes and shipping methods to 
differentiate from other online-photo competitors via high quality. Nordstrom 
distinguishes itself through a liberal return policy. Apple distinguishes its prod-
ucts through intuitive user interfaces and appealing design.
Pricing policies can be used to distinguish a firm’s offering. Warren  Buffet 
said it clearly, “Price is what you pay, value is what you get.” For example, 
Amazon.com offers 30 percent off most books’ list prices and free shipping for 
orders over $25. Price is a flexible element, and various discounts, coupons, 
and payment periods can be tested in test markets. The price can be initially 
set by estimating demand, costs, competitors’ prices, and a pricing method to 
select the price. Effective pricing requires gathering and integrating  information

about the firm’s strategic goals and cost structure, the customer preferences and 
needs, and the competition’s pricing and strategic intent [Nagle and Hogan, 2006]. 
The pricing method or strategy can seek market share, premium  pricing, or maxi-
mum profit. The cost to make the product is a floor under the price, and an esti-
mate of the total value to the customer sets a ceiling on the price (see  Figure 3.3). 
After studying competitors’ prices, the new venture can test a price on a set of test 
customers. 
Consider the setting of a price for a textbook where the total market demand 
is 10,000 books per year. Competitors have established a retail price in the range 
$60 to $80, and the demand per year for a new textbook may be described by
 D  5 10,000 2 kP (9.1)
where D 5 demand in units, k 5 estimated sensitivity constant, and P 5 price in 
dollars. The fixed cost to produce the new book is $30,000, and the variable cost is 
$10 per unit. The book is differentiated from its competition by quality and clarity. 
What price, P, would you select within the established range of $60 to $80? 
To maximize market penetration, one would select the lowest price, P  5 $60, 
since this will result in the largest demand. If market research shows that the market 
is price-sensitive and k 5 90, then when the price is set at $60, the demand is for 
4,600 units. Then the gross profit 5  (revenues 2 cost of goods) is
 GP 5 R 2 (VC 3 D) 5 (D 3 P) 2 (VC 3 D) 5 (P 2 VC)D (9.2)
where R 5 revenues and VC 5 variable cost. When P 5 $60 and k 5 90, the 
gross profit is $276,000. As shown in Table 9.5, if you raise the price to $70, 
the gross profit declines. The calculation of the best price to obtain the maxi-
mum gross profit depends on the estimated sensitivity constant. If we change 
our assumptions so that k 5 80, then we obtain the gross profit for the book as 
shown in Table 9.5. Note that $70 would be the price to maximize profit when 
k 5 80. Note that k is an estimate obtained through experience and research and 
will change over time.
In many industries, customers demand low prices, and the competitors have 
little pricing power. Pricing power accrues to companies without wide competi-
tion, such as universities that raise tuition, hospitals that increase fees, or virtual 
monopolies such as cable-television operators. Most mature companies operate

in a world of flat or falling prices due to an excess number of providers. A new 
venture can pick its pricing strategy from the three shown in Figure 9.5. Many 
new ventures use value pricing since demand will be sensitive to price and the 
new firms possess little brand equity. Demand-oriented approaches look at the 
demand for the product at various price levels and try to estimate a price that will 
provide a good market share and profitability for the long term. Many technology 
ventures with a new breakthrough product will use a premium  pricing strategy.
New technology companies usually offer new, value-oriented products. A new 
product or service is, by its unknown nature, difficult to price. Many new products 
are characterized by quality and performance uncertainty. To attract customers to 
a new product, it may be useful to offer a warranty—a contract or guarantee of 
a specified performance. Another possibility is to offer quality-contingent pricing 
that specifies a price rebate for poor performance [Bhargava, 2003].
Since customers often use price as a signal of quality when they are unfa-
miliar with a product, companies should be careful not to underprice offerings 
[Marn et al., 2004].
Using a traditional model for growth, firms can take advantage of the 
demand for new goods and services by creating and marketing products that 
satisfy a demonstrated need in the marketplace. As their customer bases grow 
and the products become more and more popular, profits begin to emerge. The 
profits are then reinvested in projects that will provide new sources of revenue 
and income. A portion of the profits is retained to build brand value, which can

be created through a variety of techniques, including aggressive pricing, savvy 
promotion, and advertising.
Promotion includes public relations, advertising, and sales methods. Select-
ing the message for advertising and the media for transmitting the message 
is a complex activity. Advertising is the art of delivering a sales proposition 
and positioning the product uniquely in the customer’s mind [Roman, 2003]. 
The initial product message is used to attract customers to the new  venture. 
Charles Revson, co-founder of Revlon, once said: “In our factory, we make lip-
stick. In our advertising, we sell hope.” Many other products and services also 
sell hope, including weight-control products and dating services. By contrast, 
Twitter and Facebook sell community. Instagram sells artistic expression. Smule 
sells musical connectivity. Advertising can enhance brand name recognition, 
create value, and enhance return for a new technology venture [Ho et al., 2005].
Entrepreneurs can employ a variety of media in their advertising efforts, 
including websites, social networks, print media, radio and television. Table 9.6 
gives a list of marketing media. Social networks have  become particularly impor-
tant. Facebook, for example, has one billion users–about one-seventh of the world’s 
population. In Section 9.6 we consider the role of social media in marketing. 
Social networks also can support word-of-mouth (buzz) promotion. Prod-
ucts that merit a buzz campaign have some unique, attractive attribute, such as 
the BMW’s Mini Cooper or a new anticancer drug. Furthermore, they should 
be highly visible. The latest fashion in clothes or accessories often runs on buzz 
with teenage girls.
Word-of-mouth marketing is often called viral marketing. The concept is 
based on an age-old phenomenon: people will tell others about things that inter-
est them. PayPal ran a successful viral marketing campaign by paying existing 
users $10 for each person they referred to the service who signed up, and by 
paying $10 to each new person who signed up. The marketing campaign cost 
PayPal tens of millions of dollars, but succeeded in generating significant buzz 
around the site. Hotmail, one of the first free e-mail services, included a small 
Hotmail advertisement at the bottom of each e-mail sent via their service. This 
tactic worked to quickly spread the word about Hotmail. As consumers increas-
ingly use digital video recorders to skip commercials, listen to podcasts and 
downloaded music instead of radio, and use e-mail filters that prevent spam, 
word-of-mouth promotion will become more important.
The Tesla Roadster is a high-performance sports automobile with a retail 
price of over $100,000. It is a fully electric vehicle that can travel over 200 miles 
per charge. Tesla generated buzz around its product by getting celebrities and tech-
nology pioneers excited about it. At one point, the waiting list was over 1,000 
people including Google’s two co-founders, Arnold  Schwarzenegger, and Matt 
Damon. Journalists spread photos of celebrities driving the vehicle throughout 
traditional and popular Internet media outlets. Despite the $5,000 deposit required 
to be placed on a waiting list, this “buzz” has helped Tesla Motors generate tre-
mendous interest in this car.

CHAPTER 9   Marketing and Sales194
Place means selecting the channels for distribution of your product and, 
when appropriate, the physical location of your stores. Channels of distribution 
are necessary to bring your product to the end user. A publisher sells a book 
through multiple channels such as bookstores, direct sales to the end user, and 
Internet bookstores, such as Amazon.com. Each industry has a some sort of dis-
tribution system. Differential advantages can accrue to sellers who creatively 
use different channels.
In the personal computer industry, Dell Computer sells direct to the end user 
via phone or the Internet, while Hewlett-Packard sells primarily via retail stores 
and value-added resellers. When several parallel channels are used, channel con-
flict can occur due to the divergence of goals between channels and domain (ter-
ritory or customer) disagreements [Brynjolfsson et al., 2009].
Many technology ventures will sell their product to other manufacturers 
who will incorporate the product as a module or component within the final 
product. For example, Intel provides microprocessors that Dell incorporates into 
its PC.
The use of the Internet as a distribution channel has caused a shift in the 
relationships between consumers, retailers, distributors, manufacturers, and 
service providers. The Internet presents many companies with the option 
of reducing or eliminating the role of intermediaries and lets those provid-
ers transact directly with their customers. Before launching an e-commerce 
effort and bypassing its traditional distribution channels, however, a business 
should analyze which  products are appropriate for electronic distribution. For 
example, information products are very compatible with electronic distribu-
tion, while bulky low- margin items like pet food may be a better fit for a tra-
ditional channel.
“Intel Inside” Campaign
In the late 1980s, Intel decided to redirect some of its advertising efforts 
away from computer manufacturers to actual computer buyers. The con-
sumer’s choice of a personal computer was based almost exclusively on the 
brand image of the manufacturer, such as HP, Dell, and IBM. Consumers 
did not think about the components inside the computer. By shifting its 
advertising focus to the consumers, Intel created brand awareness for itself 
and its products, and built brand preference for the microprocessor inside 
the PC.
The first step was to create a new advertisement using the slogan 
“Intel: The Computer Inside.” Second, Intel chose a logo to place on a 
computer—a swirl with “Intel Inside.” Then it chose a name for its new 
microprocessor—Pentium. As a result, Intel became a leader in the PC 
boom of the 1990s. Intel was successful at branding a component.

9.6   Social Media and Marketing Analytics 195
Many firms are using the Internet for selling and experimentation. Procter & 
Gamble (see www.pg.com) is using its corporate website to invite online  customers 
to sample and give feedback on new prototype products [Gaffney, 2001]. 
This approach permits P&G to test new products and their marketing mix. P&G 
conducts at least 40 percent of its tests online. In August 2000, when P&G was 
ready to launch Crest Whitestrips, a home teeth-whitening kit, it tested its pro-
posed price of $44. P&G ran TV and magazine ads to attract people to the test. 
It also sent e-mails to people who had signed up to sample new products. In the 
first eight months, it sold 144,000 whitening kits online.
Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google have emerged as key online advertising plat-
forms [Vogelstein, 2005]. Internet advertising is displacing newspaper and mag-
azines. Google and others place an advertisement in front of users when they are 
looking to buy or research an item online.
An emerging firm has to decide how and where to spend its marketing 
 dollars. It may have several product categories and numerous regions on which 
to spend its limited marketing budget. To decide, an emerging firm should 
collect  information on each regional or international market and allocate its 
resources based on the regions and products that offer the best opportunity for 
profit [Corstjens and Merrihue, 2003].
9.6 Social Media and Marketing Analytics
The world has changed dramatically in recent years with the proliferation of 
mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets, the emergence of social net-
works like Facebook and Twitter, and the ability to capture and analyze massive 
amounts of data, including data gathered from website interactions, social net-
works, call centers, and devices with smart connectivity.
These changes have created both massive upheaval and massive opportunity 
for the companies who figure out how to best leverage these new technologies. 
Commerce systems and financial transaction systems are subject to disruption 
and new ways are rapidly emerging for how commerce will be conducted in the 
21st century. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of mobile commerce, 
new payment platforms like eBay and Square, and new consumer platforms such 
as Google, Apple, and Facebook, which represent new ways for consumers to 
evaluate and buy products.
Customers have increased power in this new paradigm as a result of greater 
access to product and pricing information and an ability to get input from friends 
and acquaintances that have expertise or previous experience using the products 
or services. Customers even have new ways to buy, including group buying and 
rental instead of purchase. At the same time, companies also have the ability to 
interface with those prospects and customers in new ways that make the inter-
action between prospects/customers and those companies much more like an

CHAPTER 9   Marketing and Sales196
ongoing relationship than a buyer/seller paradigm. A new era is emerging where 
companies connect with prospects and customers on fixed and mobile devices, 
using the customers’ communication method of choice (e.g., e-mail, Twitter, 
text, phone, online, or face-to-face meetings), and communicate directly to them 
with information tailored to their specific desires and interests.
Social media and marketing analytics are at the core of these changes. Social 
media networks encourage online interactions among communities. Those com-
munities run on the Web, and the community members and Web content are 
accessible on both personal computers and mobile devices. Within these net-
works, people express and share their interests, discuss their likes and dislikes, 
and share input on millions of topics including music, careers, clothes, travel, 
education, and sports. Marketing analytics gathers and analyzes data from these 
various social media sites and merges the social media data with data that com-
panies have in their corporate databases to gain deep prospect and customer 
insights. These analyses enable companies to create highly-successful targeted 
marketing and sales initiatives. Often, messages can be custom tailored down to 
the individual level.
Wells Fargo equity research sees a $50 billion software opportunity as com-
panies try to bring together unified solutions for all prospect and customer facing 
functions of a company, including marketing, sales, customer service/support, 
and ecommerce. Marketing analytics enables marketing and sales people to 
more effectively do their jobs. In addition, it enables advertisers and publishers 
to target and optimize their display ads to generate the highest click-through 
rates and maximize online purchases. Marketing analytics tools also recommend 
the highest value-set of keywords for bidding, search engine optimization, and 
search marketing campaigns. 
Table 9.7 lists representative new marketing tools that are leveraging 
social media and marketing analytics. With this new set of tools, the conduct 
of marketing and sales has changed forever. Much of the front end of the sales 
process, including prospect identification, brand and product awareness, pro-
viding product information, and initial customer interface is moving to the 
Web or to mobile devices. The role of marketing is shifting to emphasize the 
effective analysis of large amounts of data, gathered in large part from social 
media, to determine the right time to deliver product messages to interested 
prospects and customers. Firms are gauging customer interest through the use 
of marketing analytics. The marketing department’s primary focus is shifting 
from traditional marketing activities (demand/lead generation, value proposi-
tion development, branding) to activities focused on analyzing data to figure 
out the right messages to get in front of prospects at the right time. Effective 
firms, therefore, have an integrated approach to marketing, sales, and customer 
support/service that enables both ecommerce and traditional commerce to be 
conducted in a way that provides the highest levels of prospect and customer 
satisfaction while enabling the highest return on investment for sales and mar-
keting spending.

9.7 Customer Relationship Management
The quality of the relationship that a firm has with its customers directly 
 influences the intrinsic value of the firm. Customer relationship manage-
ment (CRM) is a set of conversations with the customer. These conversations 
 consist of (1) economic exchanges, (2) the product offering that is the subject of 
the exchange, (3) the space in which the exchange takes place, and (4) the context 
of the exchange [McKenzie, 2001]. For the customer relationship to be fruitful, a 
firm must effectively manage the attraction of the customer, the conversion or sale 
of the customer, and the customer retention process. These relationships are man-
aged through brief real-time conversations that help build a relationship. These 
conversations take place between the customer and the firm in a relationship 
space, as depicted in Figure 9.6. The first part of a conversation is the economic 
exchange based on a product offering that is communicated to the customer. 
The space in which the exchange takes place could be physical, such as a show-
room, or virtual, such as a website displaying goods. The context of the exchange 
includes all that is known about the customer and the situation with the customer.
A necessary step to a CRM system is the construction of a customer data-
base. Developing a database is relatively easy for banks and retail firms since 
they have a high frequency of direct customer interaction. It is more difficult

for firms that do not interact directly with the end customer, such as semicon-
ductor and auto manufacturers [Winer, 2001]. The customer database can be 
used for CRM activities such as customer service, loyalty programs, rewards 
programs, community building, and customization.
CRM, when properly constructed, allows firms to gather customer data 
quickly, identify valuable customers, and increase loyalty by providing excellent 
service. Through the CRM process, customers become a new source of com-
petencies engaged in building the firm’s products and services as they provide 
ideas via the conversational process [Prahalad and Ramaswamy, 2000]. Unfor-
tunately, too many companies distance themselves from customers by using 
phone loops that trap and frustrate customers seeking aid.
CRM is best operated when the customer and the CRM employee are fully 
engaged in conversation. A process that fully engages the customer and the 
employee can deliver more effective outcomes for the firm and the customer 
[Fleming et al., 2005].
Progressive Corporation uses CRM to relate to its customers 24 hours a day. 
It sells auto insurance both directly and through agents. Progressive’s information 
systems allow customers to manage their accounts online, including paying their 
bills electronically and adding a vehicle or driver. It has a highly functional web-
site, telephone call centers, and claims service available 24 hours a day, seven days 
a week. Progressive’s claims agents travel quickly to the scene of an accident. The 
agents are equipped with notebook computers that communicate wirelessly to the 
corporate network, which lets them key in information on site.
Figure 9.7 depicts CRM and the total marketing effort. CRM helps improve 
marketing research, customer retention, and the marketing mix.
Firms generally strive to have repeat customers. Customers who say they 
are satisfied are not necessarily repeat customers because satisfaction is a 
 measure of what people say, whereas loyalty is a measure of what they actually 
do. Thus, customer surveys measure opinions but are unreliable predictors of 
future  behavior. Loyalty is not a matter of opinion [Klein, 2003]. Loyalty is a

measure of a customer’s commitment to a product or a company’s product line. 
Loyalty measurements are more difficult to obtain than satisfaction measures. 
Good satisfaction measurement can help identify what’s broken in your business 
today. Good loyalty measurement is a forward- looking tool that firms can use to 
devise strategies to hold on to  customers they want to keep.
Customization, sometimes called one-to-one marketing, is a process 
that enables a product to be customized (changed) to a single customer’s 
specifications. A firm uses a CRM system to elicit the information from each 
customer specific to his or her needs and preferences. Customization allows 
the company and the customer to learn together about the customer’s needs. 
 Customization is easy to do with digital goods such as music files, but other 
manufacturers can also tailor products to provide customization [Winer, 2001]. 
For example, BMW popularized the concept of designing and customizing a car 
online, which can then be purchased and delivered to a local dealership.
Salesforce Attracting Customers
CRM tools can be used to collect and organize activities involving a firm’s 
customers. For example, Salesforce (salesforce.com) enables a firm to track 
current or potential customers and to provide service, sales, and support man-
agement. Another leading CRM vendor is SugarCRM.

CHAPTER 9   Marketing and Sales200
9.8 Diffusion of Technology and Innovations
Most entrepreneurial ventures have some novelty or innovation embedded in 
their product. Customers adopt an innovation at a particular point in time based 
on their perception of its advantages and its cost and risks. The  diffusion of 
innovations describes the process of how innovations spread through a popu-
lation of potential adopters. An innovation can be a product, a process, or an 
idea that is perceived as new by those who might adopt it. Innovations present 
the potential adopters with a new alternative for solving their problem, but 
they also present more uncertainty about whether that alternative is better or 
worse than the old way of doing things. The primary objectives of diffusion 
theory are to understand and predict the rate of diffusion of an innovation and 
the pattern of that diffusion. 
Innovations do not always spread quickly. The British Navy first learned 
in 1601 that scurvy—a disease that killed more sailors than warfare, acci-
dents, and all other causes of death—could be avoided through the simple 
solution of incorporating citrus fruits in a sailor’s diet. The British Navy, 
however, did not adopt this innovation until 1795—almost 200 years later 
[Rogers, 2003]. Even the best ideas are not always quickly adopted.
The diffusion of innovations depends on a potential adopter’s perception of 
five characteristics of an innovation, as listed in Table 9.8. The adopter’s percep-
tions of these characteristics strongly influence his or her decision to adopt or 
not. Consider the introduction of black-and-white television in 1947. By 1950, 10 
percent of all households had adopted this innovation, and by 1960, 90 percent 
of households had a TV. This rapid adoption of TV was due to its relative advan-
tage compared to radio, its high compatibility within the home, its relatively low 
complexity, its easy trialability, and its ready observability in TV store windows 
TABLE 9.8 Five characteristics of an innovation.
 ■ Relative advantage: the perceived superiority of an innovation over the current product 
or solution it would replace. This advantage can take the form of economic benefits to 
the adopter or better performance.
 ■ Compatibility: the perceived fit of an innovation with a potential adopter’s existing val-
ues, know-how, experiences, and practices.
 ■ Complexity: the extent to which an innovation is perceived to be difficult to understand 
or use. The higher the degree of perceived complexity, the slower the rate of adoption.
 ■ Trialability: the extent to which a potential adopter can experience or experiment with 
the innovation before adopting it. The greater the trialability, the higher the rate of 
adoption.
 ■ Observability: the extent to which the adoption and benefits of an innovation are visible 
to others within the population of potential adopters. The greater the visibility, the higher 
the rate of adoption by those who follow.

and friends’ homes. On the other hand, consider the slow adoption of the personal 
computer in the home. PCs were introduced into the home market by 1982, but 
as late as 2007, only two-thirds of households had a PC. The complexity and cost 
of a PC discourages many consumers from adopting it in the home. Also, the 
perceived advantage is not clear to many would-be users.
As the PC example highlights, to understand a customer’s likelihood of 
adoption, it is necessary to compare his or her current “pain” to the perceived 
pain of the solution presented by your company’s product or service. For exam-
ple, without a PC and word processor, a potential customer feels pain when typ-
ing documents that cannot be easily changed and when tracking expenses by 
hand rather than by using a spreadsheet. But, adoption of a PC also imposes 
its own perceived pain. This perceived pain is not only price, but also time and 
effort required to read instruction manuals, research products, wait in line, install 
software, and so on. Customers will adopt only when their perceived benefit 
exceeds this perceived pain [Coburn, 2006].
In a rapidly changing technology area, customers may wait to adopt if they 
think that a better technology is just around the corner. For example, many 
people did not purchase plasma televisions because they suspected that LCD 
televisions would be available soon. If customers wait long enough, they can 
“leapfrog” entire technologies, as with communities in Africa and Asia that 
skipped landlines and adopted mobile phones [Economist, 2006].
The adoption of any innovation usually follows an S curve, as shown in 
Figure 9.8. When the adoption follows the S curve, then the distribution curve 
of adopters follows a normal distribution, as shown in Figure 9.9, where Sd 5 
standard deviation. The five categories of adopters are shown in Figure 9.9 and

CHAPTER 9   Marketing and Sales202
The transition from the early adopters to the early majority is difficult since 
it requires attracting pragmatists, as shown in Figure 9.10. This large gap 
between visionaries and pragmatists is called a chasm [Moore, 2000]. The early 
adopters or visionaries are independent, motivated by opportunities, and 
quickly appreciate the nature of benefits of an innovation. However, the early 
majority or pragmatists are analytical, conformist, and demand proven results

TABLE 9.9 Five categories of adopters of an innovation.
 ■ Innovators want to be on the leading edge of business and are eager to try new innova-
tions. They have an ability to work with complex and often underdeveloped ideas as 
well as substantial financial resources to help them absorb the uncertainties and potential 
losses from innovations.
 ■ Early adopters are more integrated with potential adopters than innovators and often 
have the greatest degree of opinion leadership, providing other potential adopters with 
information and advice about an innovation. They are visionaries.
 ■ The early majority adopts just ahead of the average of the population. It typically 
undertakes deliberate and, at times, lengthy decision-making. Because of its size and 
connectedness with the rest of the potential adopters, it links the early adopters with the 
bulk of the population, and their adoption signals the phase of rapid diffusion through the 
population. They are pragmatic.
 ■ The late majority is described as adopting innovations because of economic necessity 
and pressure from peers. While it makes up as large a portion of the overall population as 
the early majority, it tends to have fewer resources and be more conservative, requiring 
more evidence of the value of an innovation before adopting it.
 ■ Laggards are the last to adopt a new innovation. They tend to be relatively isolated from 
the rest of the adopters and focus on past experiences and traditions. They are the most 
skeptical when it comes to risking their limited resources on an innovation.

9.9   Crossing the Chasm 203
from an innovation. Once a product crosses the chasm, others will purchase it 
since they will readily observe and try it [Rohlfs, 2001]. Crossing the chasm is a 
challenging task for a new business. For example, the first videophone was intro-
duced in the 1960s. It was not until Skype emerged in 2003, however, that the 
technology moved toward the mainstream and it took several more years to cross 
the chasm. Another example is three-dimensional movies that first launched in 
1953. The inconveniences involved in  3-D movies have outweighed the ben-
efits, and the adoption of 3-D stalled in the 1990s [Huntington, 2003]. With the 
introduction of 3-D televisions in the 2010s, manufacturers are again making a 
push, though 3-D technology still has not crossed the chasm.
Honda introduced hybrid cars into the U.S. market in 1999. Toyota fol-
lowed in 2000 with the Prius, which enthusiasts and visionaries rapidly adopted. 
Hybrid cars have been increasingly popular and now have crossed the chasm 
into the mainstream of auto sales.
Digital photography stalled at the chasm for over a decade (1985–1995). 
Factors that held it were the lack of personal computers and software that could 
easily manipulate digital images, as well as the absence of inexpensive printers 
for printing photos [Ryans et al., 2000].
Many high-technology products are weak on both compatibility and com-
plexity. They are difficult to operate and understand. Thus, they require the 
would-be user to learn how to use them and how they work. The firm offering 
these products needs to educate the user on both these matters. In some cases, 
this education effort can be expensive and time-consuming.
All innovators are not educators; however, anyone who adopts an innovation 
has to be a learner. Even the most transparent and intuitive designs present learn-
ing challenges. A bicycle looks easy to ride. But for most adults, learning to ride 
a bicycle is difficult because they may have to fall down before they learn how. 
Teaching an adult to ride a bicycle is often an exercise in frustration. Too many 
innovators rely not on sound training sessions and documentation to support their 
users’ learning, but rather on Web pages that list frequently asked questions.

CHAPTER 9   Marketing and Sales204
Encouraging users to read the directions simply does not work. Innovators often 
try to transfer the costs of teaching and learning to their  customers. As a result, 
adoption of an innovation is delayed or halted.
Innovators with good ideas have no choice but to be educators, through 
either the medium of their innovations or teaching. They should recognize that if 
they really want to overcome customer resistance, they need to balance ease of 
use with ease of learning [Schrage, 2002].
The chasm model and the diffusion characteristics of a product help to 
explain the diffusion period required to move from 10 percent to 90 percent 
of the potential adopters. Table 9.10 shows the diffusion period for selected 
innovations.
Early on, some suggested that it could take a decade or more for the DVD 
format to be adopted. By 2003, purchases of DVD players and discs had 
doubled over the previous year. DVD sales rapidly overcame two potential 
hurdles: (1) the higher purchase price of DVD discs compared to VCR tapes 
and (2) the inability of the DVD player to record. Currently, video- on-demand 
delivered over broadband cable or satellite TV poses a challenge to continued 
growth in the DVD and Blu-ray market.
Many innovators face a chicken-and-egg problem since to use a new device, 
the user needs a widely available infrastructure. However, it doesn’t pay oth-
ers to build an infrastructure for just a few users. This is true for the world of 
wireless Web devices. Another example is the push for fuel-cell vehicles. Their 
use requires hydrogen fuel stations, but who will build them until many fuel-
cell vehicles will use them? It can be difficult to get some customers to adapt 
innovations because markets are taking on the characteristics of networks. The 
interconnections among today’s companies are so plentiful that often a new

9.9   Crossing the Chasm 205
Twitter: Reaching for the Tipping Point
Tipping points are especially evident in social networking  applications. 
Twitter, which is a microblogging website and mobile  application, 
experienced explosive growth in 2009. Its user base grew to over  
18 million US adults who accessed Twitter on any platform, which was 
a 200% increase over 2008. By 2013 Twitter had over 50 million users. 
Awareness of the site was largely spread by trusted agents with a conta-
gious message. For example, many New York Times columnists began to 
publish on Twitter, and some of their readers were enticed to join as well.
The entrepreneur is the agent who creates the vision for the new product 
and builds a marketing plan that will help potential adopters to understand and 
value the innovation and respond to the message communicated by the firm. 
This message must be persuasive, believable, and understandable. When new 
ventures have a strategy to overcome the potential adopters’ lack of knowledge 
and understanding of the product, they are more likely to receive funds from 
investors and to succeed in bringing their product across the chasm.
Marketing can be described as taking the actions necessary to create, grow, 
and maintain your firm’s place in your chosen market. To cross the chasm, 
the marketing strategy has to attract and retain pragmatists. They care about 
product’s adoption by one player depends on its systematic adoption by other 
players [Chakravorti, 2004].
Other products face a dilemma in that their value depends on how many other 
people have a compatible product. E-mail and text messaging, for example, are 
only useful when a large number of other people also have e-mail and text mes-
saging capabilities. Once these products do hit a critical mass, however, they can 
spread like an epidemic. Diffusion epidemics have three characteristics: conta-
giousness; little causes have big effects; and a big change happens, not gradually, 
but at one moment [Gladwell, 2000]. A tipping point is the moment of critical 
mass or threshold that results in a jump in adoption. This type of jump happens 
in networks where, at some point, enough people have the product that its value 
jumps significantly and the product takes off. The first text message was sent in 
1992. In the late 1990s, when rival mobile networks allowed users to send text 
messages outside of the network and when mobile phones spread among young 
people, texting grew rapidly. As a result, 2000 was the tipping point.
An epidemic is spread by a message that is meaningful and emotional to the 
receiver and motivates the buyer who finds the message sticks in his or her mind 
and passes it on to others. The persuasive message is communicated by a trusted 
agent, and it moves the buyer to act. Thus, a contagious message that is memo-
rable, motivating, and delivered by a trusted agent can take a product across the 
chasm by helping a product reach its tipping point.

quality, service, ease of use, reliability, and the infrastructure of complemen-
tary products (often called the whole product).
For a small start-up, crossing the chasm may mean focusing on a particular 
market segment or acting locally and then expanding as sales grow. Crossing a 
chasm requires assembling the whole product, through alliances with partners, 
to satisfy the pragmatic buyer in a specific target market [Moore, 2002].
9.10 Personal Selling and the Sales Force
All businesses involve selling, which is the transfer of products from one person 
or entity to another through an exchange mechanism. Selling includes  identifying 
 customer needs and matching the product or solution to those needs. For many 
technology ventures, this process is called sales and business development. Most 
firms employ a sales force to make the contacts with the purchaser. In a small 
start-up, the salespeople may have other roles, such as product development or 
market planning. 
New  ventures should develop a selling strategy and a plan of action. Then 
they locate target customers and recruit, train, motivate, compensate, and orga-
nize a field sales force. They also have to manage the interactions between cus-
tomers and  salespeople. This dialogue is influenced by the buyer’s needs and the 
 salesperson’s skills. The results of successful salesperson-customer interactions 
are orders, profits, and repeat customers. 
Selling a technology product is difficult since the product may be less 
 tangible than other items, like a house or a suit. Buying a technology prod-
uct can take longer and may require the salesper son to inspire a buyer to take 
action. Thus, the technology sales person must fully understand the product 
offering and be able to communicate its benefits clearly.
Especially in markets where the customers are other businesses (often called 
B2B for business-to-business), there may be multiple decision-makers behind 
a purchase. The ultimate user of the technology product or service is certainly 
one of them. Other decision-makers, however, could include the people who 
make the recommendation of which solution to buy, such as the information 
technology staff, and the people who actually negotiate the contract, such as the 
purchasing agent. The involvement of multiple decision-makers can complicate 
and delay the sale. This length of time from the first contact until a sales trans-
action is completed is called the sales cycle. It can be as short as one day (e.g., 
 purchasing ad listings on Google or auction listings on eBay) or many months 
(e.g., evaluating and choosing sophisticated MRI equipment for a hospital’s 
radiology lab). When purchases need to be written into an organization’s annual 
budget, it can further prolong the decision-making process. Technology ventures 
must estimate the length of their sales cycle as they develop their business model 
and financial plan.
IBM’s success from 1955 to 1990 was due to a very knowledgeable, well-
trained, and highly motivated sales force. IBM’s salespeople had real experience

with computers as well as an understanding of their clients’ needs. Thomas Wat-
son, Sr., former CEO of IBM, noted that great technological innovation com-
bined with a powerful sales force was unbeatable.
For a new technology venture with an innovative product, the salesperson 
must fully understand the product and the idea of creating a solution for the 
customer. It is the responsibility of everyone in a new venture to (1) identify 
and create a purchaser, (2) offer a creative solution, and (3) make a profit-
able sale. In many start-ups, the staff is comfortable with steps 1 and 2 but 
shies away from step 3. Without actually making the sale, the start-up is des-
tined to fail [Bosworth, 1995]. The goal is to determine the purchaser’s needs 
(or latent pain), create a solution to meet that need, and then sell it to the 
purchaser.
The solution sales process is shown in Figure 9.11. The salesperson identi-
fies the target market and makes contact with a potential purchaser. Then the 
salesperson determines the customer’s problem and needs. Based on these 
needs, the solution to the customer’s problem is created and presented. The 
benefits of the solution must be clearly communicated. Then the salesperson 
asks for the order and, with a positive response from the customer, confirms the 
order. You may have experienced this process when shopping for new clothes. 
The salesperson makes a contact and determines your needs. Then the sales-
person shows you one or more solutions (options), and you try them on for size 
and appearance. The salesperson aligns his or her comments on each solution 
in a discussion with you. When you both see a solution, the salesperson asks 
for the order. If you agree, the salesperson writes the order at the cash register. 
This process is the same, although more complex, for a purchaser seeking a new 
computer system for a government agency or an electronics firm. Salespeople 
sell themselves, show they care, and provide proof of product, consistency of 
message, authority, and scarcity. The sales process rests, in part, on the skills of 
persuasion, as later described in Section 13.2.
New ventures often use their own people to manage the sales process but 
engage others, called sales representatives, under contract, to actually sell the 
product. The advantages and disadvantages of using company salespeople ver-
sus independent representatives are shown in Table 9.11. The choice of the right 
balance of company salespeople and independent representatives is a critical 
issue for a new business.
It is also important to grow the sales force at the right pace. Often, compa-
nies beef up their sales force capacity too early, when new products are not quite 
ready. A better approach is to start with a small group of salespeople who learn 
as much as they can about customers’ responses to your product. Then, use these 
responses to refine the product and the sales/marketing strategy, and expand 
the sales force only as sales themselves accelerate [Leslie and  Holloway, 2006]. 
A new venture needs to focus on its customer rather than product  features. The 
sales force needs to find out what the customer needs, which will be a  combination 
of products, services, and the product elements. They should  provide a  solution 
to the customer needs [Charan, 2007].

CHAPTER 9   Marketing and Sales208
The emerging technology business may initially use a focused, direct sales 
force to create demand and penetrate to the primary target segment. Then, as 
growth accelerates, a transition to other segments and sales channels may be 
appropriate. It is important to clearly identify the primary target segment and 
key customers [Waaser et al., 2004].
New businesses encounter sales resistance due to competition and lack of 
knowledge of their product and its quality. One method to overcome this is to 
utilize trial periods, warranties, and service contracts. Many new ventures do an 
excellent job of building a good product and developing a solid marketing plan 
but then fail to make the forecasted sales.
We will cover the issues of international marketing and sales in Chapter 15.

9.11 Spotlight on DirecTV
DirecTV launched its satellite television service in 1994. It has become one of 
the largest providers of satellite television in the world and is a leading alterna-
tive to cable television. 
DirecTV’s target customers include households and small businesses in the 
U.S. and the rapidly growing middle class in Latin America. The company has 
worked hard to build a recognizable brand that conveys coolness, simplicity, 
and good customer relationships. They use Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube 
to engage customers and potential customers, and to reinforce their brand and 
product offering. They also targets their advertising and their service based upon 
sophisticated marketing analytics.

9.12   Summary 209
Since its launch in 1994, DirecTV has grown to more than 35 million 
 subscribers. A key to DirecTV crossing the chasm was their recognition that early 
adopters were excited by the broad channel selection and digital picture quality, but 
the mainstream market cared more about good communication and specific offer-
ings, like sports. Thus, DirecTV adjusted their marketing strategy as they grew.
9.12 Summary
Any new firm needs to build a marketing plan that describes how it will attract, 
serve, and retain the customers targeted for its products. Since a new firm nor-
mally starts without established customers, it must carefully identify the target 
market that will value its product. Market research can provide the informa-
tion about the customers, appropriate distribution channels, and communication 
methods for attracting the customer.
The new firm creates a product positioning statement and selects a mix of 
price, product, promotion, and channels to attract and satisfy the customer. Most 
new firms are challenged to cross a chasm in the diffusion process that enables 
their product to attract the pragmatic and skeptical potential customer. The mar-
keting process consists of describing or implementing the following elements:
■ Product offering
■ Target customer
■ Marketing objectives
■ Market research
■ Marketing plan
■ Sales plan
■ Marketing and sales staff
Principle 9
A sound marketing and sales plan enables a new firm to identify the 
target customer, set its marketing objectives, and implement the steps 
necessary to sell the product and build solid customer relationships.

9.13 Exercises
 9.1 There continues to be a disparity between the advertising dollars spent 
on reaching TV viewers and Internet users versus the amount of time 
that is spent interacting with each media. A large degree of Google’s 
success is attributable to taking advantage of this large gap. Research 
to determine (a) TV advertising dollars and Internet advertising dollars 
spent, and (b) the amount of time spent watching TV versus using the 
Internet. How has Google taken advantage of this disparity? What other 
major societal trends are forecasted that will continue to shift  advertising 
dollars to new mediums, and why? 
 9.2 With the explosion of mobile handsets worldwide, many marketing and 
advertising firms are looking at how to take advantage of the ubiquity of a 
communications device carried everywhere. Describe why marketers view 
the mobile handset as such a valuable marketing platform. What types of 
mobile advertising challenges do you foresee arising?
 9.3 What is viral marketing? Provide an example of a start-up using viral 
marketing to promote and sell its product or service. Why does it work 
(or not work)?

 CHAPTER 10
Types of Ventures
Even if you are on the right track, you’ll get run over if you just sit there.
Will Rogers
What forms do new businesses take and what 
are corporate ventures?
T
he appropriate legal and organizational 
 format used to establish a new venture will 
vary  according to several factors such as 
context,  people, legal and tax consequences, and 
cultural and social norms. In this chapter, we con-
sider the various organizational and legal forms 
that entrepreneurs employ to achieve their objec-
tives. New ventures can range from small business 
or consulting services to high-growth, high-
impact enterprises. When entrepreneurs establish 
a new enterprise, they must make some critical 
decisions about these matters. See, for example, 
the first steps to establishing a new corporation in 
Figure 10.1.  Important  social enterprises are often 
established as nonprofit ventures.
An important contrast to these independent 
ventures is the corporate new venture. It emerges 
within larger existing enterprises and is granted 
autonomy so it can fulfill its promise. Corpo-
rate new ventures are an important part of the 
entrepreneurial world and account for many new 
innovations. Often constrained by existing com-
mitments and  capabilities, corporations can fail 
to respond to  significant new opportunities. Well-
planned corporate ventures, however, help refresh 
and strengthen large  corporations.

10.1 Legal Form of the Firm
When establishing a new technology venture, the entrepreneur needs to choose 
the legal form of the organization. The entrepreneur should choose a legal form 
that will facilitate the business, tax, and capital-raising objectives of the new 
company. The choice of a legal form depends, in part, on how the firm and its 
owners want to handle federal taxes. For tax purposes, we will address two types 
of forms: regular taxable corporations and flow-through entities. The elements 
of taxable corporations and flow-through entities are summarized in Table 10.1. 
A corporation is a legal entity separate from its owners. A flow-through entity, 
sometimes called a pass-through entity, is one that passes all losses or gains

10.1   Legal Form of the Firm 215
through to the owners of the firm. The profits of a regular corporation are taxable 
to the corporation, and any distributions are taxable to the owners. This results in 
double taxation of any distributions such as dividends.
There are four main types of flow-through entities to choose from. They are 
the sole proprietorship with one owner, which is the simplest form; the partner-
ship; the S-corporation, which is taxed much like a partnership and is named 
for the U.S. Internal Revenue Code subchapter that covers it; and the limited 
liability company (LLC).
Table 10.2 summarizes the key elements of the five types of legal form of 
a new business. A sole proprietorship is a business that is owned, and usually 
operated, by one person. This is a simple form of doing business but exposes 
the owner to unlimited liability for all debts of the business. A partnership is 
a voluntary association of two or more persons who act as co-owners of a busi-
ness. Each partner who participates in management is liable for the acts of the 
business. Liability for all acts of a business is all-encompassing, and this factor 
encourages most entrepreneurs to set up a LLC or corporation.
The Hewlett-Packard Company was first established as a partnership in 
1937, with William Hewlett and David Packard as equal partners. Their first 
sale was eight oscillators to Disney Studios in 1939 [Packard, 1995]. In 1947, 
Hewlett-Packard was incorporated to provide for continuity of life for the firm 
as well as limited liability for the owners.
In general, many businesses start out as sole proprietorships or partnerships 
but soon migrate to LLCs or a corporate form. With unlimited liability as a risk 
of the proprietor or partnership form, it may be unwise to continue in that form 
beyond the initial period necessary for completing a business plan. Most inves-
tors will only be willing to invest in a corporation or LLC since they wish to 
avoid any liability beyond the amount of their investment. The personal liability 
of a regular corporation or an LLC is limited to the amount of capital contributed 
to the entity by that person.

CHAPTER 10   Types of Ventures216
The limited liability feature of a corporation arises from the fact the corpora-
tion is itself a legal “person,” separate from its owners. If a corporation fails and 
proper formalities have been followed, creditors have a claim only on the corpo-
ration’s assets, not on the owners’ personal assets. Because they limit liability, it 
is often wise to use an LLC or a corporation even for sole proprietorships.
Many firms that start as a small business should consider an LLC or a sub-
chapter S-corporation form. These forms allow the initial business losses to flow 
through to the owners, and these losses typically can be used to offset income 
from other sources.
 The limited liability company offers an ideal form of ownership for small 
companies. It offers limited liability to the owners along with the tax advantages 
of a sole proprietorship or partnership. An LLC is particularly attractive to a fam-
ily business that receives investments of a family’s funds since it offers continuity 
of life, limited liability to participants, and advantages in handling tax issues.
An S-corporation is a corporation that is taxed as a flow-through entity. To 
qualify, a firm must meet certain requirements regarding its owners and types of 
stock. The S-status is established by filing with the IRS and may later be con-
verted to a regular C-corporation. Some entrepreneurs prefer this election to the 
LLC. Like the LLC, the S-corporation will typically need to convert to a regu-
lar corporation to accept any venture capital or issue stock in a public market. 
Unlike an LLC, the S-corporation also is limited in the number of investors and 
it may not have foreign investors. 
As the firm grows, it may be wise to consider converting the LLC or 
S-corporation to a regular corporation since a regular corporation has several potential 
advantages. It can be sold or merged into another corporation with a tax-free exchange 
of stock. Other factors that should be considered with an attorney are the number of 
owners and investors, as well as the need to raise capital, the long-term goals of the 
business, and issues related to accounting and health-care/retirement plans.
If the intention of the new business is to raise a significant amount of funds 
to start the venture and eventually to build it to a significant size, it is wise to 
start from the beginning as a regular C-corporation. A C-corporation provides 
limited liability, unlimited life, the ability to accept investments from venture 
capitalists and other corporations, and greater flexibility when sold.
The regular C-corporation form will be often chosen by firms that intend to 
seek investment from numerous professional investors and other corporations. The 
C-corporation allows for various classes of stock, such as common stock and pre-
ferred stock. In particular, investors in a C-corporation can purchase convertible 
preferred stock, which is the most common form of venture capital investment.
A corporation or LLC can be created under state laws and usually requires 
some legal steps. The process of forming a corporation is called incorporation. 
The legal steps required for incorporation in the United States are straightfor-
ward. For example, if a team selects California as the state in which to incorpo-
rate, it files articles of incorporation with the secretary of state and then pays a 
fee. The certificate of incorporation states the name of the corporation; the broad 
business purpose; the name and address of the registrant; provisions for reim-
bursing certain damages and expenses that directors, employees, and officers

may incur on behalf of the corporation; and the authorized capital, including the 
total number of shares and the class of shares [Bagley and Dauchy, 2007]. The 
ownership shares of the corporation are called stock. 
The LLC’s articles of organization are similar to the articles of incorporation 
and establish the company’s name, its duration, and the names and addresses of 
organizers. The operating agreement is similar to the bylaws of a corporation in 
that it outlines the rights of the owners and the way the LLC will operate. The 
owners of an LLC are called members, and their ownership interests are known 
as interests. These terms are equivalent to stockholders and stock in a corporation.
Usually, a company incorporates in its home state, though many compa-
nies incorporate in another state for reasons of law or ease of doing business. 
The majority of U.S. venture-backed companies are incorporated in a handful 
of states such as California, New York, or Delaware. In addition to the large 
number of companies resident in California and New York, relative to other 
states, California, New York, and Delaware have corporate laws that are well 
developed, stable, and transparent—all characteristics that ultimately reduce the 
risk to investors. Moreover, because venture capitalists and their counsel are 
familiar with conducting financings under such laws, the speed and efficiency 
with which a transaction moves will likely be improved. 
Finally, some states have a new kind of corporation called a Benefit Corpora-
tion or B-corporation. A B-corporation voluntarily meets different standards of pur-
pose, accountability, and transparency. Specifically, B-corporations include positive 
social and environmental benefits in their purpose; they are required to consider 
not only “shareholders,” but also “stakeholders,” including workers, the community 
in which they are embedded, and the environment. Additionally, they are required 
to issue an annual report that details their social and environmental performance. 
B-corporation status does not, however, affect a corporation’s tax status. Thus, 
B-corporations can still elect to be taxed as a C-corporation or an S-corporation.
10.2 Independent versus Corporate Ventures
Many purposes exist for establishing new ventures in different formats. Table 10.3 
describes five types of new ventures. Each of these types has a set of characteris-
tics that distinguishes it. We can describe a small business as a sole proprietor-
ship, a partnership, or a corporation owned by a few people. Examples include 
consulting firms, convenience stores, and local bookstores. Typically, a small 
business has fewer than 30 employees and annual revenues less than $3 million.
A niche business seeks to exploit a limited opportunity or market to provide 
the entrepreneurs with independence and a slow-growth buildup of the business. 
This business might employ fewer than one hundred employees and have annual 
revenues of less than $10 million. On occasion, a niche business can grow over 
time into a large, important enterprise.
A high-growth business aims to build an important new business and requires 
a significant initial investment to start up. A radical-innovation business seeks to 
commercialize an important new innovation and build an important new business. 
These enterprises are the primary focus of this textbook.

CHAPTER 10   Types of Ventures218
A nonprofit organization is a corporation or a member association initiated 
to serve a social or charitable purpose. Thousands of new nonprofits are organized 
every year to serve important social needs throughout the world. A well-known 
nonprofit is the International Red Cross (www.ifrc.org).
Another type of new venture is started by existing corporations for the pur-
pose of building an important new business unit as a solely owned subsidiary or 
a spin-off as a separate company. This activity can be called a corporate new 
venture (CNV).
An independent venture is a new venture not owned or controlled by an 
established corporation, which includes the first four types in Table 10.3. An 
independent venture is typically unconstrained in its choice of a potential oppor-
tunity, yet is usually constrained by limited resources. The corporate venture is 
usually constrained in its choice of opportunities to those consistent with the 
parent business. The corporate venture, however, usually has access to the sig-
nificant resources of the parent firm [Shepherd and Shanley, 1998].
While independent and corporate ventures both face the same exter-
nal  context, their different competencies and resources cause them to develop 
 different strategies. The independent venture has more flexibility and potentially 
requires fewer resources than the corporate venture. Furthermore, the indepen-
dent venture has access to a wide range of advisors, while the corporate venture is 
advised and controlled by the parent company. Thus, the independent venture has 
the advantage of flexibility, adaptability, and high incentives, while the corporate 
venture is usually advantaged by its access to valuable capabilities and resources.
Different types of ventures also involve different levels of novelty and dif-
ferent employment relationships. Table 10.4  illustrates how venture types vary 
along these dimensions.
The bulk of this chapter focuses on intrapreneurship corporate new ventures. 
First, however, we examine nonprofits and social ventures.

10.3 Nonprofit and Social Ventures
The purpose of a new venture is to create wealth for society. Often, wealth is 
seen as financial wealth. But, many entrepreneurs seek to provide social wealth 
for their society. The product of a nonprofit hospital is a healthy patient. Only 
for the tax collector does it make a difference whether the hospital is a nonprofit 
or for-profit. A nonprofit organization is a corporation, member association, or 
charitable organization that provides a service but does not earn a profit. A non-
profit organization is permitted to generate a financial surplus but may not dis-
tribute this surplus to officers, investors, or employees. Furthermore, nonprofits 
have no owners. Any surplus must be used for the approved nonprofit mission of 
the organization. Today, nonprofit organizations are often called not-for-profits 
or NGOs. One out of every two Americans is estimated to work as a volunteer 
in the nonprofit sector. 
Nonprofit organizations have traditionally operated in the social sector to 
solve or mitigate such problems as hunger, homelessness, pollution, drug abuse, 
and domestic violence. They have also helped provide certain basic social goods, 
such as education, the arts, and health care, that society believes the marketplace 
may not adequately supply. Nonprofits have supplemented government activi-
ties, contributed ideas for new programs, and functioned as vehicles for private 
citizens to pursue their own vision of the good society.
The product of the Girl Scouts is a mature young woman who has values, 
skills, and respect for herself. The purpose of the Red Cross is to enable a com-
munity hit by natural disaster to regain its capacity to look after itself. In this 
way, the nonprofit venture forms to respond to social need.
The decision to start a nonprofit venture will be determined by the nature of the 
social opportunity and the creation of an innovative response that cannot or should 
not be performed for profit. Social functions that depend primarily on volunteers or 
members such as churches, museums, theaters, social clubs, industry associations, 
credit unions, and farmers’ cooperatives are usually formed as nonprofits.
The establishment of a nonprofit organization should follow the five steps 
of Table 6.1. The vision for the organization is defined in terms of the creation 
of social value rather than economic value. Many nonprofits can be described 
as socially conscious service organizations. Thus, the entrepreneurial team must 
be committed to the social values of the new venture with its attendant risks and 
uncertainties.

CHAPTER 10   Types of Ventures220
Once the business plan is written, the required financial and human resources 
must be determined. How will the necessary funds be acquired and the human tal-
ent attracted? The challenge is finding donors whose special interests match those 
of the new nonprofit venture and who also have the expertise and commitment to 
provide an independent check on management judgment.
Organizations that satisfy the conditions of section 501 (c)(3) of the Internal 
Revenue Service Code are called charitable organizations. These organizations 
have religious, educational, scientific, literary, and/or charitable aims. Donations to 
these organizations are tax deductible for the donor and exempt from estate taxes. 
Noncharitable nonprofit organizations are primarily set up to serve the purposes of 
their members and are also tax exempt, but donations are not normally tax deduct-
ible. Nonprofits often contemplate the establishment of a related business that will 
generate a net surplus. Often, however, they underestimate the costs and are overly 
optimistic regarding revenues [Foster and Bradach, 2005].
Leading a nonprofit requires the competencies needed for most businesses 
mixed with a commitment to the entity’s social cause. Michael Miller leads 
Goodwill Industries of the Portland, Oregon, area and has built it to $4 billion 
in revenues  by using his entrepreneurial skills [Kellner, 2002]. The strategies 
and approaches discussed throughout this book are important for nonprofits. For 
example, nonprofits should leverage technology to improve the efficiency of oper-
ations and the reach of their activities. They should also consider partnering with 
complementary organizations. The nonprofit Women in Technology partners with 
IBM to cohost an engineering camp for middle-school girls, drawing on IBM’s 
resources and expertise [Austin et al., 2007].
Nonprofits also face special challenges. For example, nonprofits often find 
it difficult to agree on who their customer is. For the Red Cross, is it the hospi-
tal, the blood donor, or the financial donor? Who is the ultimate beneficiary of 
the service? Since nonprofits are not subject to the market in the same way that 
traditional firms are, it is critical that they constantly evaluate the effectiveness 
and efficiency of their activities [Bradley et al., 2003]. Managed properly, the 
nonprofit sector can spawn very big, high-impact ventures in the same way that 
the for-profit sector does. For example, the nonprofit sector delivers much of the 
health care for most nations.
A unique form of nonprofit corporation is a consumer cooperative, which is 
a business that belongs to the members who use it. The member/owners establish 
policy, elect directors, and often receive cash dividends. Examples of cooperatives 
include credit unions, housing co-ops, food co-ops, and utility co-ops. In 1938, 
mountain climbers Lloyd and Mary Anderson joined with 23 fellow climbers in 
the Pacific Northwest to found Recreational Equipment, Inc. (REI). The group 
formed a consumer cooperative to supply themselves with quality gear, cloth-
ing, and footwear selected for performance and durability for outdoor recreation, 
including hiking, climbing, camping, bicycling, and other sports. After more than 
six decades, REI has grown into a supplier of specialty outdoor gear currently 
serving more than three million active members through 125 retail stores in the 
United States and direct sales via the Internet (www.rei.com), telephone, and mail.

10.3   Nonprofit and Social Ventures 221
Social ventures sometimes take the form of a nonprofit. As discussed in 
Chapter 4, a concern for all stakeholders, including society at large, is crucial 
to the long-term success of any venture. Social ventures are distinguished from 
other ventures by their core value proposition. The value proposition for a tradi-
tional venture is designed to create financial profit by organizing to serve mar-
kets that can afford a new product or service. Social ventures aim for large-scale 
and transformational value that accrues to some segment of society or to society 
at large. They are cognizant of financial realities. But, they do not anticipate 
or organize to obtain significant financial profits [Martin and Osberg, 2007]. 
A social venture may take the form of a nonprofit or a for-profit.
Founded by Larry Brilliant, Google.org is the charitable branch of the Inter-
net company Google. Its mission is to fight global poverty, fund new energy 
solutions, and protect the environment. The organization has over $75 million in 
investments spread throughout a number of different enterprises. It was granted 
three million shares during Google’s IPO and Google continually contributes 
1 percent of its annual profits to Google.org. Some of its main projects include 
a plug-in electric vehicle that gets 100 miles per gallon and a renewable energy 
project designed to produce electricity at a profit from wind and solar sources. A 
long-term goal for the organization is to develop a way to fund Google’s massive 
power consumption from renewable energy sources. Google’s data centers con-
sume an enormous amount of electricity every year. Google.org is hoping to fund 
new technologies that can help reduce this cost.
David Green has started several small businesses in developing countries 
to make inexpensive medical devices such as intraocular lenses and hear-
ing aids. These profitable businesses make low-cost devices that meet 
the needs of the poor without sacrificing quality [Kirkpatrick, 2003]. See 
www.aurolab.com.
David Green: Social Entrepreneur
A social entrepreneur is a person or team that acts to form a new venture 
in response to an opportunity to deliver social benefits while satisfying environ-
mental and economic values. Social entrepreneurs focus on the social welfare 
of their customers or clients, while remaining cognizant of the economic and 
environmental costs and benefits. The goal is to harness innovation for social 
and public good [Jackson and Nelson, 2004].
Social entrepreneurs are, first and foremost, entrepreneurs. Thus, like all 
entrepreneurs, they recognize and relentlessly pursue opportunities; they act 
boldly without being limited by their current resources; and they engage in a 
process of continuous innovation, adaptation, and learning [Dees et al., 2002]. 
Social entrepreneurs focus on the scalability of their ventures, ultimately seek-
ing to cause a large-scale transformation and not just a local effect [Martin and 
Osberg, 2007]. For this reason, they are especially cognizant of the importance 
of technology in facilitating their efforts.

CHAPTER 10   Types of Ventures222
Social entrepreneurs hold certain advantages over entrepreneurs in other cir-
cumstances. With a mission as the guiding vision, social entrepreneurs strive to 
organize and deploy diverse resources. They can engage volunteers, customers, 
partners, and investors through a sound business plan that furthers the organiza-
tion’s mission. In the social sector, success in the enterprise equals significance 
through improved lives and healthy communities. Social entrepreneurs focus on 
creating social value [Dees et al., 2002].
An excellent example of social entrepreneurship is the nonprofit organiza-
tion Trees, Water, & People (TWP), which has an environmental and social mis-
sion. (See www.treeswaterpeople.org.) Its mission is to reforest degraded areas 
and plant fast-growing trees in Central America. It decided to view the problem 
from the demand side and seek to reduce the demand for fuel wood. TWP teamed 
up with Aprovecho Research Center in Oregon to introduce a fuel-efficient stove 
that burns 50 to 60 percent less wood than traditional open fires by using an insu-
lated, elbow-shaped burning chamber. The Justa stove also saves lives by remov-
ing toxic smoke through a chimney. TWP gives these wood-conserving stoves to 
farmers in El Salvador as an incentive to reforest their land. Fuel conservation, 
health improvement, and reforestation are accomplished together. 
Social ventures need to have all of the attributes of non-profit ventures and 
must be able to convince people of the benefits of their social impact while 
accomplishing more with fewer resources. Kiva Microfunds (known as 
Kiva.org) is a worldwide leader in providing small business loans to people 
in developing countries throughout the world. Kiva needed to build out an 
online banking platform across dozens of countries, develop a group of will-
ing lenders, and find a set of fundable opportunities in developing  countries. 
The company started by hiring people who were highly knowledgeable 
about finance, online commerce, and building communities. Next, Kiva 
convinced key entrepreneurs and business people, including Premal Shah 
from PayPal and Reid Hoffman from LinkedIn, to join them as advisors. 
Finally the company convinced the media and the public to rally behind its 
cause. Kiva is a powerful example of successful non-profit startup that has 
created a major market with worldwide impact.
Key Success Factors for Social Entrepreneurs
10.4 Corporate New Ventures
A venture started by an existing corporation for the purpose of initiating and 
building an important new business unit or organization can be called a corporate 
new venture. Some people refer to this process as intrapreneurship. The build-
ing of the new business enterprise depends on an entrepreneurial team leading 
the effort. Corporate venturing is focused on the identification and exploitation of 
previously unexplored opportunities that utilize the resources and competencies

of an existing corporation. It is usually involved with the birth of new businesses 
and the associated revitalization of a corporation [Wolcott and Lippitz, 2007]. 
We differentiate a corporate venture from a project by (1) its newness to the cor-
poration, and (2) its independence from the existing activities, organizational units, 
and products of the corporation. The characteristics of a corporate new venture 
(CNV) are summarized in Table 10.5. Corporate new ventures are distinguished 
from normal product development efforts by their relative autonomy, freedom to 
innovate, and entrepreneurial leadership.
Table 10.6 summarizes the strengths and weaknesses of a corporate new 
venture. Corporate new ventures benefit from ready access to the capital, peo-
ple, suppliers, technologies, and brand of the parent firm. On the other hand, 
CNVs may be limited by the budgetary and control practices of the parent. Fur-
thermore, the parent firm may not have the technologies or people that the new 
venture requires. In fact, studies show that the resource advantages of the exist-
ing corporation do not necessarily translate into higher performance for CNVs 
[Shrader and Simon, 1997]. To enable a CNV to be most successful, it may be 
necessary to give the new unit more autonomy, separating it from the controls 
and limitations of its parent.
Corporate new ventures differ from independent start-ups along a variety 
of dimensions, as detailed in Table 10.7. The factors for success, however, are 
essentially the same between the two types of ventures: opportunity, vision,

commitment, capabilities, resources, technology innovation, strategy, and 
execution. Success of corporate new ventures has been shown to be positively 
associated with growth and profitability of the firm [Phan et al., 2009]. A rep-
resentation of this relationship and corporate ventures appears in Figure 10.2. 
Mature corporations that engage in new business venturing are innovative, pro-
active, and constantly renew themselves.
An entrepreneur within an existing firm, like HP or Intel, starts with a 
description of an opportunity, the required resources to pursue it, the value that 
would be created, and a plan to pursue it. The entrepreneur needs a sound under-
standing of the technology and the customer and forms a sound strategy to move 
forward [Sull and Spinosa, 2005].
There are four general models of corporate entrepreneurship. In the Oppor-
tunist Model, intrepid “project champions” toil against the odds to create new 
businesses inside a corporation. In the Enabler Model, employees are willing 
to develop new concepts if they are given adequate resources. In the Producer 
Model, the corporation assumes organizational ownership, but limits resources,

at least initially, to those provided by a specific business unit. Finally, in the 
Advocate Model, the corporation provides both resources and organizational 
ownership to encourage corporate entrepreneurship. Figure 10.3 illustrates 
these different approaches to corporate entrepreneurship. The appropriate 
model for any particular company depends on its specific objectives, such as 
whether the corporation is seeking change across the organization or only in a 
specific division [Wolcott and Lippitz, 2007].
Conventional wisdom says that large firms are weak at transforming oppor-
tunities into viable new businesses. The perceived reason for this weakness is 
the effects of bureaucracy and inflexibility that exist in large firms. Existing cor-
porations are managed on a tightly defined strategy and within highly controlled 
boundaries. Corporate inertia can flow from successes that reinforce the rigidity 
of assumptions, processes, relationships, and values. All these factors are diffi-
cult to challenge: thus, the need for new independent organizations, such as new 
venture units, subsidiaries, or start-ups.
Often, the challenge for large firms is to protect the CNV from the 
pressures and controls of existing units within the firm and to “forget” the 
parent company’s business model [Govindarajan and Trimble, 2005a]. Typi-
cally, a CNV needs to be established as a relatively autonomous unit that 
can accommodate the entrepreneurial team and its business plan. At the same 
time, large firms possess resources and capabilities that would be the envy of

individual entrepreneurs trying to strike out on their own [Katila et al., 2008]. 
Unlike individuals, firms usually possess a share of the resources, capabili-
ties, and knowledge necessary for innovation. Therefore, the challenge is how 
to achieve the right balance of integration. Table 10.8 outlines a number of 
methods that can be used to achieve this balance. Companies should develop 
strategy through disciplined trial and error, build on existing strengths, and 
work to integrate while preserving autonomy [Garvin and Levesque, 2006]. 
In 1985, Apple Computer faced several challenges. Its impressive  Macintosh 
computer was in danger of being eclipsed by the new IBM PC and its 
clones. While Macintosh enjoyed outstanding margins, Microsoft and Intel 
were quickly commoditizing personal computing. Apple was hoping that 
its Graphical User Interface (GUI) would distinguish the company, but 
Microsoft introduced Windows. Another dilemma was that the Macintosh 
platform was dependent on Microsoft for applications. Apple did have its 
own modest applications group, but it could not afford to alienate other 
independent applications developers.
In 1986, Apple spun off its applications group and appointed Bill 
 Campbell to lead the new venture called Claris. He decided to attack Micro-
soft directly and immediately recruited talented executives from within 
Apple. Apple transferred its applications software with some employees 
to Claris. Apple agreed to provide up to $20M in working capital in return 
for 80 percent of the new company with the option to buy back the other 
20 percent anytime. The Claris culture eschewed any connection to Apple. 
All employees were given Claris stock options. Salaries and benefits were 
reduced to those befitting a Silicon Valley start-up. Claris was going to 
succeed or fail on its own and there would be no safety net. Claris’s strat-
egy was to create a suite of applications that worked well together. This 
contrasted with Microsoft’s emphasis on features rather than usability. 
Within three short years, Claris has grown to nearly $90 million in profit-
able, worldwide sales through acquisitions and internal development.
Claris’s ambition became its undoing. Campbell and his team were 
frustrated with Apple’s inability to grow sales volume. Apple was more 
concerned with high margins than market share, and Claris had saturated 
the Macintosh market. As the company prepared for an IPO in 1990, Claris 
revealed a controversial growth strategy to enter the Windows applica-
tions market. When Apple executives became aware of this strategy, they 
were unhappy. They worried that Claris would make Microsoft’s Win-
dows more attractive than its own Macintosh. To Claris’s dismay, Apple 
decided to exercise its option to spin Claris back inside. Apple tried to 
retain the  executive team, but within months its members had all dispersed

10.5   The Innovator’s Dilemma 227
10.5 The Innovator’s Dilemma
As discussed in Chapters 2 and 5, disruptive innovations can revolutionize indus-
try structure and cause existing firms to decline or fail [Christensen and Tedlow, 
2000]. Incumbent firms listen to their existing customers, who usually do not 
express a desire for radical innovation before it is introduced. Eventually, the 
new innovation improves and starts to challenge the existing methods, but it may 
to start new companies. Claris remains a whole-owned subsidiary of 
Apple today with no significant impact on the greater applications market 
[Komisar, 2000].
In this decade, it is interesting to contrast the Claris saga with that of 
Apple’s iPod. The recent revitalization of Apple is dependent on entrepre-
neurial efforts to build the iPod into an entire line of breakout consumer 
products, including wireless versions, portable media devices, and home 
network products [Sloan, 2005]. In 2008, Apple launched the iPhone. 
It combines the features of an iPod with a smart phone. Apple has suc-
cessfully become a collection of corporate technology ventures that often 
redefine and recreate their business. What did Apple learn from the Claris 
experience?
TABLE 10.8 Strategies for corporations to grow new businesses.
Balance trial-and-error strategy formulation with rigor and discipline.
 ■ Narrow the range of choices before diving deep.
 ■ Closely observe small groups of consumers to identify their needs.
 ■ Use prototypes to test assumptions about products, services, and business models.
 ■ Use nonfinancial milestones to measure progress.
 ■ Know when—and on what basis—to pull the plug on infant businesses.
Balance operational experience with invention.
 ■ As leaders of emerging businesses, appoint successful managers who also are known 
for their willingness to challenge convention
 ■ Win veterans over by asking them to serve on new businesses’ oversight bodies.
 ■ Consider acquiring select capabilities instead of developing everything from scratch.
 ■ Force old and new businesses to share operational responsibilities.
Balance new businesses’ identity with integration.
 ■ Assign both corporate executives and managers from divisions as sponsors of new ventures.
 ■ Stipulate criteria for handing new businesses over to existing businesses.
 ■ Mix formal oversight with informal support by creatively combining dotted- and solid-
line reporting relationships.

CHAPTER 10   Types of Ventures228
be too late for the incumbent firm to catch up. By the time the new innovative 
firm has improved the innovation and captured the market, the existing firm has 
lost market share. The disruptive innovation gets its start outside of the main-
stream of the market, and then its functionality improves over time. The existing 
firm ignores new, potential innovations at its own peril.
Another problem for all successful firms is cannibalization, which is the 
act of introducing products that compete with the company’s existing product 
line. When companies decline to try to cannibalize their own products, they 
operate under the delusion that if they do not develop the new product, no other 
firm will do so. When new opportunities open up, new entrants into an industry 
can be more flexible because they face no trade-offs with their existing activities 
[Burgelman et al., 2004].
Intel potentially cannibalized its business when it released the Celeron in 
1998 as an alternative to its powerful Pentium line of processors. The Celeron 
featured lower performance, but it quickly became popular due to its reduced 
cost. Intel gained access to different segments of the market with little to no 
adverse effect on the Pentium and its successors.
For many large firms, the pursuit of innovation must take a backseat to 
the effective exploitation of existing competencies, the satisfaction of existing 
 customers, and the continuous improvement of existing technologies. Innova-
tions eventually become breakthroughs when the web of people, ideas, and 
technologies that surrounds them grows and evolves, forcing change farther and 
farther into the established systems they emerged from. Existing organizations 
will tend to exploit an innovation that is related to their primary forms of work 
when the innovation enhances their existing competencies. When an innova-
tion is unrelated, new organizations will typically emerge to capitalize on the 
innovation.
Established companies can offer disruptive new products of their own that 
capture new customers and produce new revenue growth [Jiang et al., 2011]. 
Instead of waiting for the threat of new products to appear, the established firm 
can create its own response to an anticipated threat. It is important for exist-
ing companies to invest in the development of disruptive innovations. Several 
companies, such as Apple and Novartis, have learned to exploit the present and 
explore the future. This is a form of hedging one’s bets [Bhardwaj et al., 2006]. 
A disruptive innovation, however, often requires new competencies, 
resources, and value net relationships. Moreover, its effective pursuit will 
likely challenge some parts of the existing business. Thus, the best strategy 
for an existing firm may be to establish an autonomous corporate new venture 
unit or subsidiary with its own mandate, vision, people, and incentives. For 
example, Apple and Novartis separate their new, exploratory units from the 
traditional ones. Each new unit has its own processes, structures, and cultures, 
but remains integrated into the existing senior management structure [O'Reilly 
and Tushman, 2004]. When IBM was confronted by minicomputers, it created 
an autonomous business unit in Florida to develop and sell a personal computer 
[Christensen and Raynor, 2003].

10.6   Incentives for Corporate Entrepreneurs 229
10.6 Incentives for Corporate Entrepreneurs
Mature firms should strive to build CNVs to experiment with novel, emerging, 
and pioneering innovation to create new dynamic growth. To pursue opportuni-
ties, firms need to identify and encourage corporate entrepreneurs [Kacperczyk, 
2012]. Corporate entrepreneurs are employees of a firm who take leadership 
responsibility for driving a venture in the firm. Art Fry, an entrepreneur within 
3M, pushed the commercialization of Post-It notes through the firm. 3M has a 
guideline that its researchers can spend 15 percent of their time working on an 
idea without approval of management.
For the effective creation of a corporate new venture, the opportunity needs 
a champion in the parent company [Greene et al., 1999]. The champion is an 
executive or leader in the parent company who advocates or provides support 
and resources as well as protection of the venture when parent company rou-
tines are breached. The champion helps, describes, and defends the venture and 
secures the necessary resources. The champion expresses confidence about the 
CNV, persists under adversity, and helps get the right people involved [Howell 
et al., 2004]. The champion enables the resource transfer process, as shown in 
Figure 10.4 [Lord et al., 2002]. 
Because leading new CNVs always carry the risk of failure, many potential cor-
porate entrepreneurs avoid joining them. They fear the loss of status that failure can 
bring. In light of these individual risks, a number of features can support corporate 
entrepreneurship. These include rewards, explicit management support, resources, 
organizational structures, risk acceptance, work design, and intrinsic motivation 
[Marvel et al., 2007]. Incentives for corporate entrepreneurs can be stock owner-
ship, bonuses, or promotion within the firm if the expected performance is attained.
A few years ago, an employee of Virgin Atlantic noticed some empty curb 
space at Heathrow Airport. In a matter of days, he secured the rights to the space 
and laid out a plan for Virgin to start a curbside check-in kiosk business unit. As 
a result, Virgin became the first airline at Heathrow to offer its business class 
passengers the advantage of getting a boarding pass without having to stand 
in a check-in line. As a result of his effort, the employee received a promotion 
[Hamel, 2001].
A key issue is the appropriate reward to a corporate entrepreneur. The cor-
porate entrepreneur who is offered large financial gains is usually resented by

his or her associates because the entrepreneur relies on corporate resources that 
he or she did not create as an independent entrepreneur would [Sathe, 2003]. A 
list of possible incentives for corporate entrepreneurs is provided in Table 10.9. 
Incentives include social incentives such as recognition, support, and a culture that 
favors individuals or teams to take the initiative to create new ideas and explore 
new opportunities. Employees can be provided slack time, which is time on the job 
for exploring as-yet-to-be-approved projects. A significant degree of autonomy 
and effective financial and promotion awards provide incentives for corporate 
entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs are less risk-averse and seek independence of activ-
ity [Douglas and Shepherd, 2002]. These preferences can be exploited by CNVs.
Of course, managers, too, need to support CNVs. A firm might have a goal 
that it will launch four new ventures each year and expect that at least one new 
venture will create an important new business. To achieve this goal, the firm 
might tie executive compensation to initiation and support of corporate new 
ventures. Another incentive is to encourage ownership of stock in the firm by 
its executives. When executives own stock in the companies they manage, they 
become motivated to increase the long-term value of their firm using corporate 
ventures [Zahra et al., 2000].
Mature firms need to exploit opportunities for novel innovations by increas-
ing their commitment to corporate new ventures. Larger, mature firms also need 
to recognize, however, the barriers to CNV: familiarity, maturity, and propin-
quity [Ahuja and Lampert, 2001]. Familiarity exhibits itself in a firm’s tendency 
to favor the routine or common knowledge and ways of doing things. Maturity 
refers to favoring fully developed knowledge rather than novelty. Finally, pro-
pinquity refers to favoring a search for solutions similar to existing solutions. 
By putting in place the right incentives for employees and managers, a firm can 
create robust and successful CNVs.

10.7 Building and Managing Corporate Ventures
Can once-mighty giants of industry restore their health after they mature and 
decline in performance? Can these mature companies use corporate new ven-
tures to transform their performance? Many studies point to significant difficul-
ties in transforming large firms [Majumdar, 1999]. Structural factors, such as 
their intrinsic complexity, formality, and rigidity, are not conducive to either

high performance or reorientation. Not only are larger firms and organizations 
structurally sluggish, but, with the passage of time, their culture becomes rigid 
and hard to change because of commitments to particular ways of doing things. 
As Dee Hock, founder of Visa, stated: "The problem is never how to get new, 
innovative thoughts into your mind, but how to get old ones out."
Large firms, however, are not entirely disadvantaged. Large firms possess 
sizable collections of knowledge and intellectual capital. Furthermore, these 
firms have many talented staff who have entrepreneurial tendencies and the 
ability to exploit this intellectual capital of the firm. Absorptive capacity is the 
ability of a firm to exploit external knowledge for the production of innova-
tions. Thus, corporate new ventures can be based on both internal and external 
knowledge to the extent that the ability to absorb and exploit it is rewarded. A 
firm's successful use of innovations depends on its ability to exploit its existing 
base of knowledge while learning about technologies that lie outside its exist-
ing competencies [Cohen and Levinthal, 1990]. 
An existing company is wise to attempt to exploit a new opportunity through 
some form of a new business. The types of new business arrangements that an 
existing corporation can use include a new independent venture, a spin-off of a 
new corporation, a transfer of the opportunity to the existing company’s product 
development department, or authorization of a small project. Figure 10.5 shows 
the four types of business arrangements and their relationships to operational 
relatedness and strategic importance. Operational relatedness refers to how the 
new business organization couples to the existing operational resources and 
competencies. Strategic importance refers to the critical nature of the long-term 
results of this new organization to the success of the parent firm. Internal corpo-
rate new ventures are most useful for high operational relatedness and high stra-
tegic importance (quadrant 1 of Figure 10.5). It is best to view CNVs as a source

of insights that can inform the strategic direction of the parent company as well as 
provide the potential for attractive returns [Burgelman and Valikungas, 2005].
An opportunity with low strategic importance and low operational related-
ness (quadrant 3) most likely calls for declining to proceed with this project or 
proceeding with a modest project until the strategic importance becomes clear.
An opportunity with high strategic importance and low operational related-
ness may call for a spin-off to a new company (quadrant 2). A spin-off unit is an 
organization that is established within an existing company and then sent off on 
its own. The parent provides some resources and capabilities and sets the spin-
off toward independence. Often the parent retains less than majority ownership 
of the spin-off. An opportunity with high relatedness and low  strategic impor-
tance (quadrant 4) is a good candidate for a modest exploratory project.
Cisco Systems established a spin-off named Andiamo Systems, which 
makes switching gear. Cisco loaned Andiamo $42 million and committed to up 
to  $142 million more. Cisco held 44 percent ownership of Andiamo. Cisco pur-
chased the remaining 56 percent from the 300 employee-shareholders for $750 
million of Cisco stock in 2004 [Thurm, 2002].
Corporate ventures are managed differently than traditional in-house corpo-
rate research and development. A corporate venture may be riskier and less sub-
ject to rigid management of internal costs than conventional corporate product 
development. Indeed, protecting venture investments from such controls is one 
reason that corporate new ventures and spin-offs are often housed outside the 
corporation’s walls.
Furthermore, in corporate venturing, returns are part financial and part stra-
tegic, whereas with pure venture capital, investors’ expected financial returns 
are paramount. Corporate ventures should follow the best practices of venture 
capital, but the dual objectives of financial and strategic returns must be bal-
anced in ways that do not concern venture capitalists.
Large corporations can make room for radical, low-cost innovations by 
establishing a process for finding and funding new ideas [Wood and Hamel, 
2002]. Table 10.10 describes a three-step process for finding, evaluating, and 
funding new entrepreneurial entities. First, expand the conversations about new 
opportunities widely throughout the firm. Then, establish a process for selecting 
and funding the best ideas. Finally, keep the budgetary control within the new 
venture and avoid letting traditional managers begin to control the budget of the 
new venture.
To extract maximum value from corporate new ventures, managers should 
adhere to the set of principles outlined in Table 10.11. The process of oversee-
ing corporate new ventures is different from that used to maximize gains from 
 existing business units.
Corporate entrepreneurs gain acceptance for new ideas by influencing 
organization members’ perceptions about the nature of organizational interests. 
For an initiative to be accepted as part of the official company strategy, belief 
in the idea must be linked to corporate organizational goals. Most large com-
panies prefer to separate new venture efforts from their core business. This

permits the new venture to focus on the new opportunity and readily gather 
and coordinate the necessary capabilities and resources [Albrinck et al., 2002].
The elements of a business as practiced by the parent firm and the corporate 
new venture are shown in Table 10.12. In general, the parent firm has developed 
assets, revenues, reward systems, and management practices that tend to support 
growth, fairness, and policies that lead to orderly progress. The corporate new 
venture needs to leverage its assets to create new revenue streams by rewarding 
entrepreneurial actions and flexibility. Furthermore, the CNV wants to attract 
the best talent of the parent company. Separating the CNV from the parent com-
pany enables the CNV to act quickly with flexibility to seize new opportunities.
Many companies use a portfolio strategy for holding ownership in several 
corporate new ventures as subsidiaries or spin-offs. These companies also use 
a new venture development process based on the development of a business 
plan and the analysis of what form of CNV is appropriate. This process is sum-
marized in Table 10.13 [Albrinck et al., 2002]. At each step of the process, the 
parent company must evaluate the best next steps. Step 1 helps the CNV take 
shape as a venture champion and entrepreneurial team are identified. Step 2 
includes the development of an initial concept statement and the outline of the 
TABLE 10.10 Establishing conditions for corporate new ventures.
 ■ Increase the sources for innovation: New 
ideas tend to evolve and expand through 
conversation. The more people you can 
get involved, the more high-quality ideas 
you will generate.
 ■ Establish a process for collecting and 
evaluating ideas: Establish a forum for 
assessing the merits of various proposals 
to ensure that the most worthy ideas 
receive funding.
 ■ Do not let traditional executives con-

protecting their own departments and 
are unwilling to risk small amounts 
of resources on new and untested 
ventures.

elements of a business plan. The next step is to complete the development of 
a comprehensive business plan. Step 4 is focused on selecting the best orga-
nizational form for the CNV, based on the long-range objectives of the parent 
[Miles and Colvin, 2002]. Finally, in step 5, the corporate new venture is estab-
lished with the requisite resources, talent, and capabilities transferred from the 
parent  company.
The selection of the appropriate form (step 4) should try to fit the needs and 
strategy of the parent company. For example, 3M usually incorporates the CNV 
within an existing or new division. Conversely, Barnes and Noble, when consid-
ering the establishment of an online unit, decided to spin off a new  company into 
the stock market.
The Virgin Group, under the leadership of Richard Branson, has created 200 
new businesses in many industries such as media, airlines, and music. Business 
ideas come from anywhere in Virgin Group, and Branson remains accessible to 
employees who have proposals. Branson also hosts gatherings for employees 
where they can give him their ideas. One employee proposed a bridal planning

service including wedding apparel, catering, air travel, and hotel reservations. 
She became the CEO of Virgin Bride. Virgin Group works to start independent 
new ventures (see www.virgin.com).
Landmark Communications launched the Weather Channel as an internal 
new venture in 1981 [Batten, 2002]. With Landmark’s strong corporate sup-
port and commitment, the Weather Channel became a top weather information 
source. With the help of Landmark’s talent, knowledge, resources, and capa-
bilities, the new venture took off through several deals with cable operators. 
By 1996, the Weather Channel was also available online. The Weather Channel 
succeeded because of the investment of significant resources of Landmark. The 
Weather Channel was started in the face of widespread skepticism but  prevailed 
because of the assets and capabilities of Landmark.
Existing firms have the capability to organize a market, turning an idea into 
something that can be economically produced, marketed, and distributed to the 
customer. Entrepreneurs are able to explore new technologies quickly and effec-
tively, and make the creative leap from technological possibility to something 
that meets consumer needs. Effective firms that meet the challenge of change 
possess people who are capable of both tasks.
Many new innovations are introduced by pioneer firms, and a learning phase 
is started in the market. Existing corporations can recognize these new innova-
tions and quickly join in the innovation-commercialization phase, exploiting 
their capability to produce, market, and support new products.
In the early 1990s, the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly built a series of inter-
nal ventures focused on medical devices. By 1994, Lilly had created four 
internal corporate venture divisions in the medical devices area concerned 
with cardiac and vascular issues. By September 1994, Lilly incorporated 
these units into a new company, Guidant, and consummated an initial pub-
lic offering of its common stock. By September 1995, Lilly disposed of its 
ownership, and Guidant was a separate company. Guidant is an excellent 
example of growing from a group of internal corporate ventures to became 
a leading company. By 2006, Guidant had annual revenues approaching 
$4 billion and was purchased by Boston Scientific for $27 billion.

The life cycle of a market, such as the telephone industry, can be portrayed 
by Figure 10.6. The first stage is the introduction of a disruptive technology 
such as Bell’s telephone. Then the key application, step 2, is identified and 
exploited. A dominant design emerges for the product and the market starts to 
grow  (step 3). Process innovation, step 4, occurs as the product usage grows. 
When the marketplace matures, experimental innovation occurs in step 5. Later 
in maturity, the customer relationship processes are improved. In decline, busi-
ness model innovation is used (step 7). Finally, structural innovation capitalizes

on disruption to industry relationships. These eight types of innovation are sum-
marized in Table 10.14 [Moore, 2004]. In order to renew an existing firm, the 
leaders must choose the appropriate innovation depending upon the life cycle of 
the industry.
Many critics depict incumbent firms as going into decline in the face of 
radical technological innovation. This tendency is not universal, however, 
nor should it be inevitable. Corporations can respond effectively to new 
technological innovations when they are prepared and organized to do so.

10.9   Summary 237
Firms that have a history of navigating turbulence and creating loosely cou-
pled, stand-alone divisions, and possess a critical complementary asset have 
a good chance of managing the challenge of a radical innovation [Hill and 
 Rothaermel, 2003].
10.8 Spotlight on Twitter
Jack Dorsey created Twitter, an online social networking service, in 2006. The 
service quickly gained popularity, exceeding 500 million registered users in 
2012. Twitter enables users to send and receive text-based messages of up to 140 
characters. These messages are known as “tweets.”
Twitter began as an internal project at the podcasting firm Odeo. In 2006, 
Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams, Noah Glass and other members of Odeo formed 
Obvious Corporation. They then acquired Odeo and its assets, including Twitter.
com. In 2007, Twitter spun off into its own company. 
As CEO, Dorsey led the firm through several rounds of capital funding 
by venture capital firms. Over the period 2007 to 2012, Twitter raised about 
$160 million. Twitter had about $100 million in 2013 revenues and is building 
advertising sales on its website. The emerging business model for Twitter is 
based upon advertising revenue from firms desiring to reach the wide range of 
Twitter users.
10.9 Summary
There are five types of new ventures: small business, niche, high-growth, non-
profit, and corporate. Important contributions have been made by small and niche 
businesses, especially when they later grow and extend their mission globally. 
High-growth ventures including radical innovation start-ups are very important 
to creating growth and jobs as well as providing an important service or prod-
uct that makes a difference. A special form of new venture, called a nonprofit, 
enables an organization to meet an important social purpose.
Finally, corporate new ventures make important contributions of novelty 
and creativity that provide new vigor for existing large enterprises. For many 
firms, the pursuit of innovation and creation of a new venture independent of 
the existing structures may renew the vigor of the firm. A corporate new venture 
needs the right amount of slack, independence, and resources to create a novel 
business.
Principle 10
An important, vigorous new business venture can emerge from a large 
firm when afforded the appropriate balance of independence, resources, 
and people to respond to the opportunity.

T
he new venture organization should carefully protect its intellectual 
property. Trade secrets, patents, trademarks, and copyrights can provide 
significant long-term value for a company and create barriers to entry 
for possible competitors. An organizational plan that supports a collaborative, 
performance-based culture and a sound compensation scheme must be created 
to attract good talent. The acquisition of resources and capabilities and facilities 
will be planned for and initiated in order to build momentum for the venture. The 
management of operations, processes, and manufacturing will be described in an 
operations plan. A plan for outsourcing some activities and acquiring necessary 
assets and technologies will facilitate the early growth of the firm. Finally, the 
venture team will describe the potential for acquisitions, if any, and the plan for 
operating internationally in order to further stimulate growth.

Intellectual Property
When one door closes, another door opens; but we often look so long and so regretfully 
upon the closed door that we do not see the ones which open for us.
Alexander Graham Bell
How does an entrepreneur protect a new 
 venture’s intellectual property?
N
ew ventures need to have a plan to build 
and protect their intellectual  property. 
The proper array of trade secrets,  patents, 
trademarks, and copyrights can add up to a set 
of very valuable proprietary assets. For many 
new firms built on innovation and technology, 
 intellectual property can provide a competi-
tive advantage in the marketplace. Licensing, 
including the licensing of university-developed 
innovations, can be an important source of new 
technology or a potential source of revenue.

CHAPTER 11   Intellectual Property244
11.1 Protecting Intellectual Property
Within intellectual assets is a subset of ideas, called intellectual property, that 
can be legally protected [Davis and Harrison, 2001]. Property is defined as 
something valuable that is owned, such as land or jewelry. Furthermore, we 
can  distinguish real property (or physical property) from intellectual property.  
Intellectual property (IP) is valuable intangible property owned by persons 
or companies. A comparison of the qualities of physical and intellectual prop-
erty is provided in Table 11.1.
Since knowledge and innovation are keys to competitive success, the man-
agement of intellectual property is important to most firms. For many firms, 
intellectual assets are the wellsprings of wealth and competitive advantage. The 
protection of intellectual property can lead to the possession of valuable assets; 
for example, the patents that cover the MP3 music/audio standard. 
The protection and enforcement of legal ownership of intellectual property 
is more difficult than for physical property. How can a firm tell that another firm 
has used or taken its intellectual property? Unauthorized copying or illegal use 
of intellectual property can be difficult to discern and prove. The owner of a text-
book or a CD purchased at a store has the right to share it with another person 
but is precluded by law from copying it for sale to another person.
As intellectual property is difficult to defend, it may be useful to develop a 
strategy to deter misappropriations [Anand and Galetovic, 2004]. Suitable strate-
gies include overwhelming competitors by continually out innovating them and/
or licensing the IP to create cooperation with competitors.
The purpose of intellectual property law is to balance two competing inter-
ests: the public and the private. The public interest is served by the creation 
and distribution of inventions, music, literature, and other forms of intellec-
tual expression. The private interest is served by rewarding people for creating 
and publicly disclosing these works through the establishment of a time-limited 
monopoly granting exclusive control to the creator.
During the course of working for a firm, an employee has an idea for a 
new product that is outside of the scope of the business of the firm. Who owns 
this intellectual property, the employer or the employee? Does it matter whether 
the new idea was conceived on the weekend? Entrepreneurs should avoid any

11.2   Trade Secrets 245
potential complication or dispute of ownership of intellectual property by assid-
uously following the legal and moral laws of property. They should also reread 
all employment agreements that may state restrictions on their ownership of 
intellectual property. For example, most universities require that graduate stu-
dents and faculty sign a form assigning intellectual property rights to the univer-
sity for any invention made using university resources or made in the course of 
university-sponsored research.
Clearly, if a firm plans to apply for a patent or use some technical advance 
of a proprietary nature, the firm and its employees should not at first openly 
reveal the details to outsiders. Eventually, however, investors, partners, or 
other outsiders may require that the firm reveal more information about the 
 proprietary asset. Moreover, firms sometimes may find that strategic revealing 
of  intellectual property can slow down the competition by discouraging their 
own R&D  investments [Pacheco-de-Almeida and Zemsky, 2012].
Many technology start-ups take several years to reach the market and 
become profitable. Typically, these new ventures are founded on a significant 
array of intellectual property such as patents. When the entrepreneur’s personal 
knowledge is perceived to be a critical portion of the intellectual property, then 
this person will be expected to remain with the firm for several years. Arrange-
ments such as employment agreements and stock vesting terms will help ensure 
this active involvement [Lowe, 2001].
Intellectual property can be extremely valuable—and violating intellectual 
property rights can be extremely costly. Analysts estimate the intellectual property 
market to be $100 billion annually. At IBM, patents and licenses represent 15 percent 
of revenues. Conversely, NTP received a $612.5 million settlement against Research 
In Motion, the makers of the Blackberry mobile phone, for patent infringement.
A useful reference for an entrepreneur is Patent, Copyright, and Trademark, 
by Richard Stim [2012]. Although it is important for entrepreneurs to educate 
themselves about intellectual property, they are strongly advised to seek profes-
sional legal assistance. Technology law firms sometimes advise new ventures 
and defer payment of cash fees until the company receives its first investment. 
These law firms often help the venture get under way for three to six months 
in return for a small percentage of equity (e.g., 1.0 percent) [Henderson et al., 
2006]. If the venture succeeds like an Electronic Arts or Google, the attorneys 
will reap great financial benefits.
Intellectual property may be protected in a variety of different ways. The 
most common types of protection are trade secrets, patents, trademarks, and 
copyrights. We consider each type in the following sections.
11.2 Trade Secrets
A trade secret is a confidential intellectual asset that is maintained as a secret 
by the owner and provides the owner with a competitive business advantage. 
A trade secret may include knowledge, methods, ideas, formulas, or the like.

CHAPTER 11   Intellectual Property246
The period of life for a trade secret is potentially indefinite. The formula for 
Coca-Cola has been a trade secret for over a century. Trade secret protection 
may be lost, however, upon any unauthorized disclosure, such as theft, vio-
lation of confidentiality, independent recreation, or reverse engineering. The 
potential protection offered by secrecy depends on the attributes of the intellec-
tual property and the circumstances of its use. Secrecy is valuable for formulas, 
algorithms, and know-how that can be implemented by a firm without its being 
known by other than a few people. If the knowledge must be widely shared 
throughout the firm, it will be difficult to protect it from those who would copy 
or imitate it.
Many production processes can be protected behind the walls of the 
firm. For example, methods for manufacturing integrated circuits are widely 
 available, but the best production process for making them is quite complicated. 
Several semiconductor firms keep their competitive advantage by maintaining the 
secrecy of their methods as well as their processes. The risk always exists that 
an employee will learn the secrets of the methods and the process and decide to 
start a  competitor firm. 
A firm will have to balance the need to protect secrets with the necessity to 
widely share information among employees. Employees must be informed that 
they are dealing with secrets that are the property of the firm and they are expected 
to protect these secrets. For many firms, common knowledge among employees 
of the methods and procedures is necessary for success. For them, it is the execu-
tion of the total business process that provides the competitive advantage.
A non-disclosure agreement (NDA), sometimes called a confidentiality 
agreement (CA) or confidential disclosure agreement (CDA), is one method 
of protecting a trade secret. An NDA is a legal contract that prohibits the 
covered parties from sharing certain information with any third party. For 
example, two firms exploring a potential partnership may sign an NDA so that 
they can share proprietary information with one another while not releasing it 
to the public.
A non-compete clause in an employment agreement, sometimes called an 
NCC or a non-compete, can prohibit an employee from starting or working for 
a firm that may compete with his or her current employer. The intention of a 
non-compete is to prevent a former employee from exploiting technical or mar-
keting know-how in service of a competing business [Marx, 2011]. Enforcement 
of non-competes, however, varies widely in the United States. In California, for 
example, non-competes generally are invalid except for equity stakeholders in a 
business.
11.3 Patents
Abraham Lincoln called the introduction of the U.S. system of patent laws “one 
of the three most important events in the world’s history” [Schwartz, 2002]. A 
patent grants inventors the right to exclude others from making, using, or selling 
their invention for a limited period of time. In the United States, this is  generally

11.3   Patents 247
20 years from the date of filing once the patent issues. A patent for an invention 
is the grant of a property right by the country in which the application is filed. 
Patents may be granted to new and useful machines, manufactured products, and 
industrial processes, and to improvements of existing ones. Patents also may be 
granted for new chemical compounds, foods, and medicinal products, as well as 
for the processes for producing them. 
Utility patents are issued for the protection of new, useful, nonobvious, and 
adequately specified processes, machines, and articles of manufacture. Exam-
ples include the patent for the safety razor and the rolling bag that is widely used 
by air travelers.
Design patents are issued for new original, ornamental, and nonobvious 
designs for articles of manufacture. For example, Apple received a design patent 
for the rounded edges of the rectangular screen of the iPad. Plant patents are 
issued for certain new varieties of plants that have been asexually reproduced.
A business method patent is a type of a utility patent and involves the 
creation and ownership of a process or method, such as Amazon’s “one-click” 
ordering process. While U.S. Courts had more broadly allowed business method 
patents in the past, under current law the extent to which these patents may be 
allowed has been curtailed.
An invention must be considered novel and useful to be considered for 
patentability. It must also represent a relatively significant advance in the 
state of the art and cannot merely be an obvious change from what is already 
known. Such requirements are meant to reduce the number of inventions 
that modify existing products in minimal ways. Patents are often granted for 
improvements of previously patented articles or processes if the requirements 
of patentability are otherwise met. However, the granting for an improve-
ment does not by itself give the holder any rights to the underlying patent. In 
general, patents tend to work well in industries where the core technology is 
biological or chemical [Shane, 2005].
A patent is recognized as a type of property with the attributes of personal 
property. It may be sold or assigned to others or mortgaged, or it may pass 
to the heirs of a deceased inventor. Because the patent gives the owner the 
right to exclude others from making, using, or selling the invention, the owner 
may authorize others to do any of these things by a license and receive royal-
ties or other compensation for the privilege. If anyone makes use of a patented 
invention without authorization, the infringement can be brought to court in 
a suit filed by the patent holder, who may request monetary damages as well 
as a court injunction to prevent further infringement [Elias and Stim, 2003]. 
A patent only protects what is stated in its claims. An inventor tries to make 
multiple claims, but must often write narrow claims to avoid conflict with a 
 previous patent.
The patent process requires an application that includes a clear, concise 
description of the invention. It also defines the boundaries of the exclusive rights 
that the inventor claims. Furthermore, patents are territorial so inventors must 
apply for patents in each country where they wish to protect their inventions.

CHAPTER 11   Intellectual Property248
A provisional patent application is a legal document submitted to the U.S. 
Patent and Trademark office for the purpose of establishing an early filing date. 
The provisional application includes a description of the invention but does not 
include the formal patent claims or other detailed information. The applicant 
must file for a regular nonprovisional patent within 12 months, which undergoes 
the standard review process. Filing a provisional patent application also gives 
the applicant the legal right to use the term Patent Pending.
Once a patent has been issued, the owner may start a patent protection pro-
gram that includes issuing notices and labeling products or services covered 
by the patent, monitoring uses of the patent, and pursuing known or suspected 
infringers of the patent. The patent provides the owner the right to exclude others 
from using the patent without compensation. However, the owner is responsible 
for enforcing that right by sending notices to infringers and possibly resorting to 
litigation, if necessary. Sometimes imitators are able to design new products or 
methods that circumvent the existing patent. 
The value of patents can be high. In August 2011, Google acquired Motorola 
Mobility for $12.5 billion. At the time, Motorola Mobility was losing money but 
Google saw a tremendous amount of value in the mobile patents held by Motor-
ola. Smart phones and tablets were becoming the preferred end-user device for 
interfacing with the Web. At the same time, software applications running on 
hosted cloud computing infrastructures were enabling a whole new set of appli-
cations to be accessed on mobile devices. The risk of not being able to partici-
pate in mobile and cloud computing was too large for Google to undertake. So it 
acquired a company with mobile computing know-how. Perhaps more important, 
Google acquired a set of patents, which would enable it to participate in the fast-
growth mobile and cloud computing sectors. 
Patents have proved to be very effective for inventions in the pharmaceuti-
cal and medical instruments industries: while a laptop computer may include 
more than 500 patented inventions held by many firms, a pharmaceutical drug 
will normally be covered by a single patent. Thus, drug companies typically 
enjoy strong intellectual property positions.
In many industries, firms eager to capture gains from their innovations are 
filing patent applications at an unprecedented rate. Several legal changes and 
court decisions in the 1980s provided more protection for patents. The 1985 
case in which Polaroid won more than $900 million in damages from Kodak for 
instant-camera patent infringement provided strengthened precedence for patent 
infringement litigation. More recently, U.S. courts found that Samsung infringed 
several Apple patents and awarded Apple $1 billion in damages in 2012. Court 
decisions also have expanded patentable subject matter to include genetically 
modified organisms, software, and, in certain cases, business methods.
Growth in the number of patents issued in the United States in recent years 
is shown in Table 11.2. In 2012, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued 
nearly 269,000 patents. Companies are increasingly building their innovation 
strategy around patents and intellectual property. IBM, for example, was granted 
more than 6,400 patents in 2012.

11.4   Trademarks and Naming the Venture 249
Patenting an innovation can be expensive since a single patent applica-
tion can cost $20,000 in filing, examination, issuance, and attorneys’ fees. In 
addition, the cost of infringement litigation can be very high. Proving patent 
infringement requires documentation and analysis of the infringing product 
or process. Fledgling entrepreneurs cannot expect to have the funds required 
to file for patent protection for all intellectual property and to litigate all pos-
sible infringements. Therefore, they must determine when it makes sense to 
pursue a patent. First, entrepreneurs should evaluate the core technologies 
that are fundamental to the business’s success. If a technology is outside of 
this core, it probably should not be patented. Second, the entrepreneur should 
consider whether a competitor could easily invent an alternative to the pat-
ented technology. If so, then the technology probably should not be patented. 
Entrepreneurs should also consider whether other, less costly, forms of pro-
tection might be effective, such as trade secrets.
At the same time, it is important to recognize that patents can be useful 
when bargaining with other companies and can be a positive symbol of innova-
tive capacity when raising money. Therefore, it is wise for entrepreneurs to con-
sider the role of patents beyond the simple protection of a particular invention. 
In developing and maintaining its patent portfolio, a new venture should follow 
the steps outlined in Table 11.3.
11.4 Trademarks and Naming the Venture
A trademark is any distinctive word, name, symbol, slogan, shape, sound, or 
logo that identifies the source of a product or service. The holder of a trade-
mark gains rights as the trademark is used. In the United States, registering a 
trademark gives the holder advantages in enforcement. A registered trademark 
is renewable indefinitely as long as commercial use is proven. A new venture

CHAPTER 11   Intellectual Property250
should consider trademarking its company name, symbol, or logo. Commonly 
known trademarks include Kodak, Apple, Google, the NBC logo, and Yahoo.
The trademark owner has the right to bring legal action to halt any infring-
ing use for damages and recovery of profits. Trademark rights are often among 
the most valuable assets of an emerging new venture in today’s competitive 
 marketplace. The goodwill and consumer recognition that trademarks repre-
sent have great economic value and are therefore usually worth the effort and 
expense to properly register and protect them [Sandner and Block, 2011].
A good trademark is an integral part of a firm’s brand. To possess good value, 
a trademark should readily be associated with and exclusive to the firm. Excellent 
examples of a powerful trademark are the Apple logo and the Intel Inside logo. 
There were 243,000 newly registered trademarks in the United States in 2012, and 
there are an estimated total of 1.8 million registered trademarks in the United States. 
Companies may also file an “intent to use” trademark application. However, the 
company must actually be using the trademark before it can be registered.
A firm may lose the exclusive right to a trademark if it loses its unique 
character and becomes a generic name. Aspirin, thermos, and cellophane are 
examples of names that have become generic. Coca-Cola and Xerox have suc-
cessfully protected their trademarks.
A company’s name is often its most important identifier. The name of 
a new company should be memorable, related to the product or service, 
and attractive. It is also helpful if it can be used as the company’s website 
domain address. The right name can evoke a sense of the company’s charac-
ter, bestow distinction, and make a powerful impression. Ideally, the name 
tells the prospective customer about the product. For example, Facebook is a 
virtual facebook or directory of individuals. LinkedIn links people into a net-
work. Many firms such as Dell and Craigslist, are named after their founders. 
Other firms use creative names, such as Twitter or Uber. Some firms use a 
locational name, such as Silicon Valley Bank or Allegheny Technology.
The right name can deliver a subtle message about the firm’s unique fea-
tures. Tinker Toys evokes a spirit of play. If possible, a name will serve as a 
marketing tool and will be easy to remember, spell, and say. Jeff Bezos chose 
the name Amazon.com because it conveyed the idea of a huge entity and did not 
limit him to one product [Leibovich, 2002].
It is best to test the proposed name of your firm on other people since it 
is important to avoid negative connotations. Founder Scott Cook of Intuit, the 
makers of Quicken, tried and rejected the name Instinct for his new company 
because it sounded like “it stinks” [Taylor and Schroeder, 2003]. Once a suit-
able name is chosen, a name search will be required to ensure that no one else 
has already claimed the name. Then, the name is registered with the appropriate 
state office. If national and international operation is envisioned, it may be wise 
to register the name as a trademark with the U.S. Trademark Registry Office.
In late 1984, Leonard Bozack and Sandra Lerner initially financed their own 
new firm with funds from their credit cards. They named the company cisco, as 
in the end of the name of the city of San Francisco. Lerner designed the logo in 
bye23429_ch11_241-256.indd   250bye23429_ch11_241-256.indd   250 18/10/13   9:00 AM18/10/13   9:00 AM

the form of the Golden Gate Bridge. Eventually, they capitalized the name to 
become Cisco [Bunnell, 2000].
A new venture should make sure that the name does not translate into some-
thing embarrassing or negative in a foreign language, and that the name carries no 
other undesirable connotations. Another factor is its pronounceability. A software 
company supporting Linux chose Red Hat as a memorable name and created a 
red hat logo. Other examples of good, memorable, robust names include Wal-
Mart, Intel, General Electric, and Microsoft. On the articles of incorporation, the 
name typically must include the word “Incorporated,” “Corporation,” or “Com-
pany.” Moreover, the name usually cannot contain certain words like “insurance” 
or “bank” without meeting additional criteria [Bagley and Dauchy, 2007]. 
Once the new venture chooses its name, it should reserve a domain name 
for its website and e-mail address. New ventures should check into the avail-
ability of a domain name early on, because doing so often eliminates certain 
choices for company names and trademarks. The best situation is when you 
can use the same legal name and domain name. Good examples of memorable 
corporate names that are also used as domain names are Google and Yahoo.
11.5 Copyrights
A copyright is a right of an author to prevent others from printing, copying, or 
publishing any of his or her original works. For copyrights created today, the life 
of the copyright is for the life of the author plus 70 years after the author’s death. 
Because copyright protection automatically attaches upon creation of a work 
and the process of registering a work with the U.S. Copyright Office requires 
only the completion of a simple form, the process of obtaining copyright protec-
tion demands very few resources.
A copyright extends protection to authors, composers, and artists, and it 
relates to the expression rather than its subject matter. This is important, because 
a copyright only prevents duplicating or using the original  material. This does not 
prevent use of the subject matter. Therefore, software programs, books, and music 
are protected from copying, but the ideas in these forms may be used by others.
The protection provided by copyright is somewhat limited. In the software 
field, for example, courts have narrowed the scope of copyright protection. 
Copyright is most effective against wholesale copying of all or a significant 
portion of a program. It has limited protection for functional aspects of soft-
ware products, such as the underlying algorithms, data structures, and protocols 
of multimedia technology. Copyright also may protect fanciful aspects of the 
graphical user interface of a program.
11.6 Licensing and University Technology Transfer
Licensing is a contractual method of exploiting intellectual property by transfer-
ring rights to other firms without a transfer of ownership. A license is a grant to 
another firm to make use of the rights of the intellectual property. This license 
bye23429_ch11_241-256.indd   251bye23429_ch11_241-256.indd   251 18/10/13   9:00 AM18/10/13   9:00 AM

CHAPTER 11   Intellectual Property252
is defined in a contract and usually requires the licensee to pay a royalty or fee 
to the licensor.
Many firms have a large number of unexploited or underexploited pat-
ents that a licensee may be able to exploit. IBM, for example, widely grants 
licenses, and its royalty income amounts to more than $1 billion each year. IBM 
holds more patents than any other U.S. company and licenses its software pat-
ents widely. But, while most new firms realize that intellectual property can be 
among their most valuable and flexible assets, they remain unaware of the earn-
ing potential of their patent holdings.
Licensing can form the core of a business model. For example, licensing is 
widely used to provide software to users. Microsoft derives most of its revenues 
from license fees for its Office suite and Windows operating system. Dolby Lab-
oratories Inc. gets much of its revenue from licensing its products to electronics 
makers. It succeeds this way partly because of its well-known technology and the 
reasonable price it charges other firms for use of the technology.
A new venture can derive valuable income streams by licensing its intel-
lectual property to other firms for noncompetitive, complementary uses. The 
benefits to the licensor include spreading the risk, achieving expanded market 
penetration, earning license income, and testing new products and markets. Dis-
advantages of licensing may include risk of infringement and nonperformance 
of the licensee.
A new venture also can save time and resources by licensing another firm’s 
technology to use in its products. The terms of the license with the third-party 
technology owner establish what rights a start-up has to use, distribute, modify, 
and sublicense the licensed technology. Licensing terms often are structured in 
recognition of a start-up’s high potential but lack of capital. For example, a firm 
may waive or minimize the up-front license fee charged to a start-up. But, in 
return, it may demand a percentage of sales revenue once the start-up releases a 
product.
Rambus’ Patent Stream
Rambus was founded in 1990 and went public on the NASDAQ in 
1997. The company derives most of its revenue from licensing patent 
 technologies for chip interfaces. Rambus’ customers include SONY, 
Intel, AMD, Infineon, NEC, and Toshiba. Rambus had revenues of 
$312  million in 2012.
Most start-ups founded on the basis of university-developed technologies 
will need a license from the university. Even if a student or professor is both 
the inventor and the entrepreneur who brings the technology to market, most 
universities own the intellectual property since they provided the lab space, 
salaries, and other resources to conduct the research. Thus, the inventor must 
obtain a license. Inventor-entrepreneurs who wish to avoid licensing their own

11.8   Summary 253
inventions from the university must be careful to work on these inventions with-
out using university resources. 
In exchange for the license, the university typically requires some combina-
tion of an up-front fee, an annual fee, a percentage of related product revenue, 
and/or equity in the start-up. The university may grant an exclusive license, 
which provides just one company with the right to develop the invention. Alter-
natively, a nonexclusive license provides rights to multiple companies simul-
taneously. Often, universities offer a hybrid between the two approaches, such 
as exclusivity for one field or application area or exclusivity in one geographic 
region, such as North America.
Inventors of a technology that a university licenses can benefit from the 
marketing and intellectual property assistance that the university provides. 
Inventors also share in the revenue that the university collects based on the 
invention. A typical arrangement splits the revenue such that one-third goes to 
the inventor (or is split among the inventing team), one-third goes to the inven-
tor’s department, and one-third goes to the school, after patenting and adminis-
trative expenses are subtracted out.
11.7 Spotlight on Apple
Apple, Inc. was founded on April 1, 1976, and incorporated on January 3, 1977. The 
firm was established to sell the Apple I computer kit. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak 
designed and assembled the contents of the kit, which sold for $666.66. The Apple 
II was introduced on April 16, 1977, and incorporated VisiCalc, a spreadsheet pro-
gram. On December 12, 1980, Apple went on the public market for $22 per share. 
In the early 1980s, Apple encountered clones that copied the operating sys-
tem of its Apple II computer. The company won a historic legal battle in 1982, 
when the courts determined that copyright could protect the software embed-
ded in computer chips [Roberts, 2012]. Over time, Apple has carefully designed 
an intellectual property strategy that covers each product through a variety of 
design patents, utility patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. In 2012 
and 2013, Apple engaged in another major legal battle with Samsung over each 
company’s mobile devices. 
11.8 Summary
The plan to acquire, build, and protect the intellectual property of the new venture 
should be clear to all the participants. The proper array of trade secrets, patents, 
trademarks, and copyrights can come together as a strong set of valuable propri-
etary assets. For high-growth, technology-based companies, intellectual property 
can be used to build a competitive advantage. Well-protected intellectual property 
can be licensed to others as a source of revenue. Alternatively, ventures based 
upon university-developed technology will need to obtain a license. Entrepreneurs 
should avoid the ten mistakes with legal matters described in Table 11.4.

The New Enterprise Organization
Two people working as a team will produce more than three working as

Charles P. McCormick
How can entrepreneurs best organize and 
reward the people who will lead their venture 
to success?
A
fter recognizing an opportunity and deciding 
it is attractive, usually one or two founders 
 assemble a new venture team to build a plan 
and an organization to execute it. A key aspect of any 
team is that its members possess different core compe-
tencies and are able to work in a collaborative manner. 
A new firm also builds a set of advisors and a board of 
directors to provide guidance and counsel as the team 
moves forward. The senior leaders of the venture are 
identified early in the organization’s development. 
These leaders must be capable of inspiring and motivat-
ing others to join the new venture. 
As an organization grows, managers will be needed 
to carry out the tasks that keep the organization running 
well. A leader is a team’s emotional guide and exhibits 
solid emotional intelligence. As the organization grows, 
the firm works to build an organizational culture and trust 
among team members. Leaders and teams strive to build 
social relationships and networks to foster collaboration. 
Knowledge assets and intellectual capital are poten-
tial sources of wealth. Sharing knowledge throughout a 
firm can enhance the firm’s processes and core competen-
cies, thus making the firm more innovative and competi-
tive. Most technology ventures are based on knowledge 
and intellectual property that must be enhanced and man-
aged. A learning organization is skilled at creating and 
sharing new knowledge.

CHAPTER 12   The New Enterprise Organization258
12.1 The New Venture Team
The first step toward forming a new venture is often taken by one or two indi-
viduals who recognize a good opportunity and then develop a business concept 
and vision to exploit it. After a short period, it becomes clear that a team is 
required in order to have all the necessary capabilities in the leadership group. 
We define a team as a few people with complementary capabilities who are 
committed to a common objective, goals, and approach for which they hold 
themselves mutually accountable. In a true team, as opposed to a group, mem-
bers are fully integrated and feel responsible for their collective output. Think 
of the contrast, for example, between a basketball team that has difficulty func-
tioning without all players and a group of tennis players who act independently 
toward a common goal.
The new venture team is a small group of individuals who possess expertise, 
management, and leadership skills in the requisite areas. In knowledge-intensive, 
dynamic industries, entrepreneurial teams outperform single entrepreneurs, since 
the new venture requires more capabilities than one individual is likely to have 
[Beckman et al., 2007]. It is the combination of complementary capabilities that 
leads to success. Thus, the advantage of a team results from bringing together 
people with diverse characteristics, skills, knowledge, and capabilities, each 
of whom is an expert in his or her own particular area [Fischer and Boynton, 
2005]. While some similarities between team members are important to facilitate 
communication and fast execution, these differences allow for greater breadth 
and creativity and may facilitate the identification of more market options for 
 technology-based firms [Furr et al., 2012]. 
Vinod Khosla suggests that entrepreneurs should “engineer the gene pool” 
when they assemble a team. Often, entrepreneurs assemble a team by identifying 
who they know. Khosla suggests that they should instead identify what they do 
not know: what perspectives, skills, expertise, and experience are missing from 
the current team? He then recommends that entrepreneurs use tightly defined 
criteria for specific positions to identify the best people to fill these roles. Typi-
cally, these people will already have positions and will need to be recruited away 
from another firm. By filling all gaps and building a world-class team, the new 
venture has a much better chance of success [Khosla, 2012]. 
Typically, a team of two to six people is required to develop a business plan, 
secure the financing, and launch the firm into the marketplace. It is important 
to ensure that each team member contributes fully and serves a critical role. 
Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, argues that team size should follow 
the “two pizza rule”: just two pizzas should feed the entire team. Otherwise, the 
team is probably too big.
The capabilities of the one or two lead entrepreneurs are critical to the new 
venture since others are willing to join the team based on the integrity, experi-
ence, and commitment of these lead entrepreneurs. Often we call the lead entre-
preneurs the founders. In other cases, all the members of the initial leadership

12.1   The New Venture Team 259
team are called the founders. The founders display all the characteristics of 
capable entrepreneurs: passion, commitment, and vision. Entrepreneurs under-
stand the long-term implications of the information-based, knowledge-driven, 
and service-intensive economy. They know what new ventures require: speed, 
flexibility, and continuous self-renewal. They recognize that skilled and moti-
vated people are central to the operations of any company that wishes to flourish 
in the new age. 
Furthermore, these new ventures must exhibit adaptability and readiness to 
change as the context of the business evolves. The organizational arrangement 
of the firm must evolve as the market and the customer change. Newly-formed 
firms are challenged by this necessity to change since they usually have limited 
resource and capability bases. Strong teams ensure that the firm is able to con-
stantly reorganize in terms of strategies, structures, systems, and resources. The 
new venture team must have the skills to balance the needs for change, efficien-
cies, alignment of effort, and timeliness. The team must include one or more 
persons who can gain access to external sources of funds. One of the advantages 
of a new organization is that people can use active thinking rather than precedent 
as a basis for action [Pfeffer and Sutton, 2000].
Effective teams also depend on shared understandings and good team pro-
cesses. Team members should support the team effort and engage in “buy-in” 
without respect to the entrepreneurial task [Shepherd and Krueger, 2002]. Each 
member should feel comfortable making suggestions, trying things that might 
not work, pointing out potential problems, and admitting mistakes. The team 
should create a frequent and rich flow of ideas and meet regularly to trade these 
ideas. The innovation process consists of the appropriate use of questioning, 
trust, and openness of the team [De Jong and Elfring, 2010]. The team consis-
tently seeks the best potential product that will create significant value [Estrin, 
2009]. Table 12.1 lists several characteristics of an effective team.
 ■ All members share leadership and own-
ership of the team’s tasks.
 ■ Communication is continuous among 
members in an informal atmosphere.
 ■ Tasks and purposes are well understood.
 ■ People listen to each other and are 
 comfortable with disagreements within 
the team.
■ Most decisions are reached by 
consensus.
TABLE 12.1 Characteristics of an effective team.
■ Feedback on performance is frequent.
■ The division of tasks and work effort is 
clear.
■ A collaborative effort is the norm.
■ Members set their own, shared interim 
deadlines for project stages.
■ Team members rely on each other and 
hold each other accountable.
■ Teams learn and share their learning.

CHAPTER 12   The New Enterprise Organization260
Although entrepreneurs typically focus on full-time employees as consti-
tuting the team, it is useful to conceive of the firm’s board of directors and 
board of advisers as part of the team, too. An incorporated firm or LLC has a 
board of directors. A board of directors is a group composed of key officers 
of a corporation and outside members responsible for the general oversight of 
the affairs of the entity. This board normally consists of the founders of the 
firm and one or more investor-owners. A new start-up might find a board of 
three owners is adequate. As other investors are added, one or more additional 
owners may added to the board. The board is the overseer of the corporation 
with responsibility to select and approve the appointment of the chief execu-
tive officer (CEO) and other officers of the corporation. Directors should pos-
sess significant knowledge and competencies in the industry of the company. 
The board of directors is a legally constituted group whose responsibility is to 
represent the stockholders. A board of five might consist of two insider exec-
utives, two representatives of investors, and one independent director. This 
board must approve the bylaws, officers, and annual report to the shareholders, 
as well as any financial offerings to investors or banking activities. The mem-
bers of this board have fiduciary responsibility, meaning that they are under 
a legal duty to act in the best interests of the corporation and its stockholders. 
The board of directors for a new venture typically differs from the board 
of directors for a large established corporation in several key areas, as outlined 
in Table 12.2. For example, members of the board of directors for a venture 
tend to have deep industry expertise and significant financial incentives. They 
can also have a greater diversity of interests, however, and may have conflicts 
of interests between their investment interests and the venture’s performance. 
Geese heading south for the winter fly in a V formation. As each bird 
flaps its wings, it creates uplift for the bird immediately following it. By 
flying in a V  formation, the whole flock can fly at least 71 percent farther 
than if each bird flew on its own. People who share a common direction 
can get where they are going more quickly and easily if they cooperate.
Whenever a goose falls out of formation, it feels the resistance of try-
ing to go it alone and quickly gets back into formation to take advantage of 
flying with the flock. Teams will work with others who are going the same 
way. When the lead goose gets tired, it rotates back in the formation, and 
another goose flies on the point. It pays to take turns doing hard jobs for the 
team. Perhaps the geese honking from behind are even the cheering squad to 
encourage those up front to keep up their speed.

12.1   The New Venture Team 261
Entrepreneurs are advised to consider how board composition should change 
as their venture grows.
In selecting directors, a premium should be placed on a wide range of exper-
tise and backgrounds [Tuggle et al., 2010]. Above all, boards should include 
people who will seek to expose the downsides as well as the upsides of every 
major decision. Directors should work for better governance of the firm. They 
should know the strategy of the firm and keep everyone focused on the firm’s 
innovation strategy. Savvy start-ups look for directors who are fluent in one or 
more of the following: audit and finance, strategy, marketing, and sales. 
Compensation of directors will normally be in the form of stock. The mem-
bers of the board should, after a few years, have a reasonably substantial stake 
in the firm. This can be achieved with the use of stock options or restricted stock 
that vests over a period of time.
The board of advisors, if a venture chooses to have one, is constituted to 
provide the firm with advice and contacts. The members have good reputations 
and extensive skills and knowledge in order to provide good advice. The board 
of advisors is nonfiduciary and does not engage in the legal or official actions of 
the corporation. Thus, the advisors are free from liability as long as they refrain 
from any legal or official role. At a minimum, advisors have their venture-related 
expenses, as with travel to meetings, reimbursed. They can be granted stock, too, 
though typically both their compensation and involvement are less than that of 
members of the board of directors.
Good boards are those that function and work well. They are distinguished 
by a climate of trust, respect, and candor. Members feel free to challenge each 
other’s assumptions. They should feel a responsibility to contribute significantly 
to the board’s performance. In addition, good boards assess their own perfor-
mance, both collectively and individually [Sonnenfeld, 2002]. Table 12.3 lists 
five goals for an effective board process [Finkelstein, 2003].

CHAPTER 12   The New Enterprise Organization262
12.2 Organizational Design
Organizational design is the design of an organization in terms of its leader-
ship and management arrangements; selection, training, and compensation of 
its talent (people); shared values and culture; and structure and style. The nine 
elements of an organization are listed in Table 12.4. Note that the last four ele-
ments in the list can be considered as the elements of an organizational design.
The talent consists of the people, often called employees, of an organization. 
The leadership team and the firm’s managers are responsible for communicating 
and leading the firm in the appropriate direction. The shared values and corporate 
culture are the guiding concepts and meanings that the members of an organization 
share. The structure of a firm is its formal arrangement of functions and activities. 
Style is the manner of working together—for example, collegially or team-oriented.
What is the best way to organize a group of people so as to maximize pro-
ductivity and innovation? Most successful innovative organizations include many 
small units having free communication with each other, significant independence 
in pursuing their own opportunities, and freedom from central micromanagement. 
Lending Club is a New York based start-up looking to dis-intermediate the 
consumer and small business loan market.  The company offers person-to-
person lending with lower rates than a borrower would traditionally get from 
a bank.  Lending Club has built a board with a number of high-profile bank-
ing and financial executives including John Mack, the former chairman of 
Morgan Stanley, Lawrence Summers, the secretary of the treasury during 
Bill Clinton’s presidency, Hans Morris, the former president of VISA and 
CFO at Citi Markets and Banking, and Mary Meeker, one of the world’s 
most well-known and respected technology analysts while she was at Mor-
gan Stanley.  Lending Club uses this board for advice but also to add cred-
ibility to the company and validity to the new consumer and small business 
lending model used by Lending Club.
Lending Club’s Board of Directors
TABLE 12.3 Five goals for an effective board process.
 1. Engage in constructive conflict—especially with the CEO.
 2. Avoid destructive conflict.
 3. Work together as a team.
 4. Work at the appropriate level of strategic involvement—avoid micromanagement.
 5. Address decisions comprehensively.

12.2   Organizational Design 263
They avoid layers and bureaucratic structures, and keep communication flowing 
with a bias toward action [Joyce et al., 2003]. Innovation grows most rapidly 
under conditions of an intermediate degree of fragmentation. Excessive unity 
and excessive fragmentation are both ultimately harmful. The best organization 
design is one of teams or units that compete and generate different ideas but main-
tain relatively free, open communication with each other [Diamond, 2000].
Competency-based strategies depend on talented people operating in a 
loose-tight structure. Thus, hierarchical structures need to be replaced by net-
works, bureaucratic systems need to change into flexible processes, and control-
based management roles need to evolve into relationships [Bartlett and Ghoshal, 
2002]. Flexible organizations that effectively adapt to change are often called 
organic organizations. 
Organizational performance is the result of individual actions and behavior. 
Successful firms have people who take the right actions in concert with others. 
Thus, the form of the new enterprise is often a network characterized by rela-
tionships within the firm. In general, the firm starts off as a single team, and as it 
grows, it evolves into a series of cross-functional teams.
Southwest Airlines has been productive due to its effective use of its 
major assets—its aircraft and people. Southwest uses relational coordina-
tion (RC), which describes how its people act as well as how they see them-
selves in relationship to one another [Gittell, 2003]. RC requires frequent, 
timely problem-solving carried out through shared goals, shared knowledge, 
and mutual respect. Three conditions that increase the need for RC are recip-
rocal interdependence, uncertainty, and time constraints—all common to new 
business ventures.
One model of an organizational design is shown in Figure 12.1. The three 
activities of an organization are operations, innovation, and customer relation-
ship management (CRM). These activities all support the key objective of the 
organization to create and maintain a sustainable competitive advantage. The 
integration of innovation, operations, and CRM can lead to a strong competitive

advantage. The Internet and an intranet can help provide low interaction costs 
between the three activities. Most new ventures have an advantage because 
their newness permits them to easily integrate the three activities shown in 
 Figure 12.1, thus rapidly gaining a competitive edge.
A new venture normally starts out with a team or a collaborative structure 
that primarily consists of teams with few underlying functional departments. In a 
collaborative structure, the operating unit is the team, which may consist of 5 to 
10 members. The best collaborative structures are self-organizing and adaptive. A 
self-organizing organization consists of teams of individuals that benefit from 
the diversity of the individuals and the robustness of their  network of interactions. 
This collaborative effort coupled with the self-organizing behavior of the network 
can lead to benefits that exceed the sum of the parts—often called synergy.

12.3   Leadership 265
12.3 Leadership
Leadership is the process of influencing and motivating people to work together 
to achieve a common goal by helping them secure the knowledge, power, tools, 
and processes to do so. Leadership is critical to an entrepreneurial venture and is 
normally provided by one or two leaders of the new venture. The leader of a new 
venture can be thought of as a leader of a jazz band that is known for its ability to 
play familiar and new music while collaboratively creating and im proving new 
variations. Mobilizing an organization to adapt its behaviors in order to thrive in 
changing business environments is  critical. Responses to challenges reside in the 
collective intelligence of employees at all levels who need to use one another as 
resources, often across boundaries, and together learn their way to those solutions.
A good leader is hopeful about the venture’s goals and can readily describe 
the vision of the venture. They communicate a clear vision and the value of the 
venture and are convinced they are the one to make it happen. Good leaders 
make good judgement calls about people, strategy, and challenge [Tichy and 
Bennis, 2007]. Judgement is the nucleus of leadership and is based on a prac-
ticed process of naming and framing the issues, exercising good judgement, and 
listening to the team. Most leaders are skilled at framing the issue and creating 
the case for change, strategy, and actions needed. Then the team proceeds to the 
execution phase and makes the required steps for success.
The leader of the new venture responds to routine work and challenging work 
issues in different ways, as shown in Table 12.5 [Heifetz and Laurie, 2001]. The 
The Palo Alto Networks’ founders, management team, and board of direc-
tors brought a wealth of experience to the company that enabled them to 
develop industry-leading products, to gain significant market share versus 
entrenched companies, and to scale to the point of an IPO. Nir Zuk, the 
founder of Palo Alto Networks, was also the CTO at Netscreen, a com-
pany acquired by Juniper Networks, and the CTO of OneSecure, a com-
pany that competed in a market similar to Palo Alto Networks. The Palo 
Alto Networks management team members have been key drivers of some 
of the most important network security companies and related technolo-
gies in the last 15+ years, including the invention of stateful inspection, 
hardware-based security, and intrusion prevention. The engineering team 
brings a proven track record in delivering high-quality networking and 
security solutions at companies like Check Point, NetScreen, McAfee, 
Juniper Networks, and Cisco. When they were getting ready to go pub-
lic, Palo Alto Networks hired Mark McLaughlin, who had previously 
served as president, CEO and director at Verisign, another leading secu-
rity company.

CHAPTER 12   The New Enterprise Organization266
most important capability of the entrepreneur-leader is the ability to cultivate 
and make use of the competencies of the talented team members [Davidsson, 
2002]. Responding to challenges and adapting the effort of the tal ent is the role 
of a leader. Challenging problems confronting an organization require the mem-
bers of the organization to take responsibility for solving the problem. Thus, the 
leader helps the team members confront the challenges and learn new ways to 
solve the problems.
Leaders build companies through a blend of personal humility and pro-
fessional will [Collins, 2001]. They are ambitious, but primarily for the orga-
nization, not themselves. Leaders have the drive to build great companies through 
the efforts of the team members. They seek sustained results and facilitate new 
approaches to challenging situations while maintaining clear goals and methods 
for routine work. Leadership is the ability to acquire new organizational meth-
ods and capabilities as the situation changes. The leader stimulates discussion so 
that people contribute and understand the issues, ultimately leading to a shared 
strategy for sustained advantage.
There are four styles of leadership, as shown in Figure 12.2 [Northouse, 
2001]. A leader’s behaviors are both directive (task) and supportive (relation-
ship). Directive behaviors assist group members in goal accomplishment through 
giving directions, establishing goals and methods of evaluation, setting time 
lines, defining roles, and showing how the goals are to be achieved. Supportive 
behaviors involve two-way communication and responses that show social and 
emotional support to others.
The supporting style is used when a leader does not focus exclusively on 
goals but uses supportive behaviors that bring out the employees’ skills around 
the task to be accomplished. The directing leader gives instructions about what 
and how goals are to be achieved by the subordinates and then supervises them

carefully. The coaching style calls for a leader to focus on goal achievement 
and give encouragement to subordinates. The delegating style occurs when 
the leader is less directive and facilitates employee confidence. Most effective 
leaders adopt all four styles of leadership depending on the needs of the situa-
tion and the team members while operating within the central target area. The 
leader of a new technology venture will most likely use a directing-supporting 
style in the early period of the venture. Later, in the growth period of the firm, 
the leader will probably use a mix of all four leadership styles.
Leaders exhibit seven traits, as recorded in Table 12.6. Leaders are seen as 
authentic, decisive, focused, caring, coaching, communicative, and improvement-
centered [Collins and Lazier, 1992]. Leaders articulate a clear, compelling vision 
for the venture and stimulate the team to achieve high performance. They avoid let-
ting talk substitute for action. They also strive to develop a sustainable  competitive 
advantage through building new competencies and products in a timely way. Lead-
ers have a bias for simple concepts that can be clearly understood and acted on. 
Informed action is their goal. The entrepreneurial leader uses a collaborative style 
while setting high standards and driving toward achievement.
Teaching is at the heart of leading. In fact, it is through teaching that 
leaders lead others. Teaching is how ideas and values are transmitted in an 
organization. Leading is helping others to see a situation as it really is and 
to understand what responses need to be taken so that they will act in ways 
that will move the organization toward where it needs to go. Organizational

CHAPTER 12   The New Enterprise Organization268
performance is the result of individual actions and behaviors. In successful 
companies, people do the “right things.” Those companies have effective 
leaders who create conditions under which their people have the information, 
authority, and incentives to make the right decisions. When leadership is effec-
tive, behavior at all  levels of the organization is both aligned and adaptable; 
thus, the organization performs to its potential.
Leaders have a guiding vision and passion that allow them to communicate a 
sense of hope to followers. The key to this communication is integrity and cred-
ibility. Leaders with both have a heightened sense of self-awareness and a strong 
understanding of what they believe in and value. The five functions of leadership 
are challenging the status quo, inspiring a shared vision, enabling people to act, 
modeling through personal example, and motivating people to act.
Leaders display an inner strength and a constant set of values that every-
one knows and can rely on. They avoid self-aggrandizement, inspire others, and 
exhibit a combination of modesty and extraordinary competence.
What makes a great leader? One study reveals a key attribute: the capabil-
ity to handle adversity and to learn from such experiences [Bennis and Thomas, 
2002a]. Bennis and Thomas call these shaping experiences crucibles. These 
experiences make leaders stronger and more confident. Leaders are formed by a 
combination of their individual personalities and the events of the era in which 
they spend their formative years, which are then transformed in a crucible of 
experience and challenge. They organize the meaning of these experiences into 
capacities to respond to future challenges. These great leaders also evidence a 
capability to adapt as well as resilience, and are not necessarily charismatic 
[Khurana, 2002]. They are likely to be capable people with solid experiences 
that helped shape and build their leadership skills.
Finally, the leader is a venture’s emotional guide. Emotional intelli-
gence (EI) is a bundle of four psychological capabilities that leaders exhibit: 
self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship man-
agement, as described in Table 12.7. Self-awareness refers to the ability to 
understand one’s moods, emotions, and motivations, as well as their effect 
on others. Self-management is the ability to control emotions, as well as 
TABLE 12.6 Seven traits of leaders.
 ■ Authenticity: consistent actions and 
words
 ■ Decisiveness: willing to act on limited, 
imperfect information
 ■ Focus: create a priority list and stick 
to it
 ■ Care: build relationships and social 
capital
■ People skills: offer helpful feedback and 
good coaching to all team members
■ Communication: stimulate conversation 
and communicate vision
 ■ Continuous improvement: keep learning 
and energy flowing in the firm, retain 
optimism

exhibit optimism and adaptability. Social awareness is the empathetic sens-
ing of other people’s emotions and awareness of the social currents within an 
organization. Relationship management includes inspiration, influence, conflict 
management, and teamwork.
According to Goleman and colleagues, leaders and managers who pos-
sess these capabilities have a high degree of EI and tend to be more effec-
tive. Their self-awareness and self-management help to elicit the trust and 
confidence of their colleagues. Strong social awareness and relationship man-
agement skills can help to earn the loyalty of their colleagues. Empathetic 
and socially adept persons tend to be skilled at managing disputes between 
people, better able to find common ground and purpose among diverse con-
stituencies, and more likely to move people in a desired direction than leaders 
who lack these qualities.
People with high emotional intelligence tend to (1) behave authentically, (2) 
think optimistically, (3) express emotions effectively, and (4) respond flexibly in 
their relationship styles.
Leaders and managers who are in touch with their colleagues are said to be 
in resonance, which is the reinforcement of emotion. People are in resonance 
when they are “in sync” or on “the same wavelength.” Resonant leaders use their 
EI skills to spread their enthusiasm and resolve conflicts [Goleman et al., 2001]. 
Good teams work to establish group resonance by building emotional and social 
awareness and management.
12.4 Management
Management is a set of processes such as planning, budgeting, organizing, 
staffing, and controlling that keep an organization running well. Managers are 
concerned with the allocation of resources and may be particularly focused on 
routine tasks. The management of a new venture firm will work to accomplish 
all the tasks required to keep the company operating. Management of a new firm 
is important and should not be undervalued compared to entrepreneurial leader-
ship—both are valuable. The goal of the manager is to make a business carry 
out activities efficiently and on time. Managers work hard on focused goals in 
order to implement the strategy of the firm. They make deliberate choices about 
TABLE 12.7 Four elements of emotional intelligence.
 ■ Self-awareness of one’s emotions, emo-
tional strengths and weaknesses, and 
self-confidence; the ability to read one’s 
own emotions
 ■ Self-management of honesty, flexibility, 
initiative, optimism, and emotional self-
control; the ability to control one’s emo-
tions and act with honesty and integrity
 ■ Social awareness of empathy and organ-
izational currents, and recognition of the 
needs of followers and clients
 ■ Relationship management achieved by 
communicating through inspiration, 
influence, catalyst actions, conflict man-
agement, and collaboration

CHAPTER 12   The New Enterprise Organization270
resources. One reason that purposeful managers are so effective is that they are 
adept at conservatively leveraging resources, such as time and money.
Managers use their personal contacts when they need information or help. 
These informal networks create part of the social capital of an organization. Peo-
ple who link and connect people through a business network can be valuable 
managers who cross boundaries, help build subnetworks, and make the organi-
zation work [Cross and Prusak, 2002].
Managers are good at pattern recognition—making generalizations out of 
inadequate facts. Good managers are also prepared, frugal, and honest. Getting 
employees to stick to important strategic initiatives—and to give those initia-
tives their undivided attention over time—is crucial to competing successfully. 
Great organizations have outstanding strategies and capabilities as well as the 
mechanisms necessary for executing the firm’s strategies. The follow-through 
with operations and processes is part of a firm’s competitive advantage. Man-
agers focus on performance, feedback, and decision-making. They are also 
synthesizers who bring resources together in a timely manner. Given the rate 
of change of the competitive environment, they can make a great contribution 
by managing resources on a rolling time scale of 12 to 18 months.
Managers set expectations by describing the desired outcome, not the path. 
Talented people will determine the best path once they know the desired result. 
Most good managers motivate their people by offering them the opportunity for 
achievement, recognition for achievement, the work itself, responsibility, and 
growth or advancement [Harzberg, 2003]. Managers need to tell employees the 
span of their job, the support they can expect, and what they will be accountable 
for. Then, as they achieve good results, they should receive the credit due to 
them [Simons, 2005].
Good managers turn the team members’ talent into good performance. They 
engage people in decisions that directly affect them, explain why decisions are 
made the way they are, and clarify what will be expected of them after changes 
are made. They also provide feedback to team members regarding their perfor-
mance. Organizations profit when employees ask for feedback and deal well 
with criticism. Openness to feedback is critical for all staff in a new venture 
facing many transitions. As people begin to ask how they are doing relative to 
management’s priorities, their work becomes better aligned with organizational 
goals [Jackman and Strober, 2003].
All successful managers excel in the making, honoring, and remaking 
of commitments. A commitment is any action taken in the present that binds 
an organization to a future course of action. Managerial commitments take 
many forms, from capital investments to personnel decisions to public state-
ments, but each exerts enduring influence on a company. A commitment 
may impede a response to changing conditions. Managers can learn to recog-
nize when commitments have become roadblocks to needed changes. They 
can then replace those roadblocks with new, rejuvenating commitments. The 
ability to make and rewrite commitments is an important managerial skill 
[Sull and Spinosa, 2005].

12.5   Recruiting and Retention 271
Management of a new venture is complex. Managers balance five per-
spectives: reflection, analysis, contextual dynamics, relationships, and change 
[ Gosling and Mintzberg, 2003]. Reflection can lead to understanding. Analysis 
can result in better organizational arrangements and performance. Understand-
ing of context (or environment) can lead to regional and global activities. Col-
laboration with other firms and sound industry relationships are important. Also, 
a bias toward action and beneficial change is another valuable perspective for 
a manager. The effective manager weaves together all five perspectives into a 
fabric for growth and performance.
Managers can make better business decisions if they ask for evidence of 
the efficacy of a proposed action [Pfeffer and Sutton, 2006]. The first step is to 
demand evidence (facts) that proves that a proposed action or process will work. 
Look for gaps in logic, inference, and applicability to your situation. Managers 
should consider running trial programs, pilot studies, and small experiments to 
help provide facts and insights that can lead to better management.
12.5 Recruiting and Retention
New ventures serious about obtaining profits through people need to ensure that 
they recruit the right people in the first place. The organization needs to be clear 
about what are the most critical skills and attributes needed in its applicant pool. 
The notion of trying to find “good employees” is not very helpful. Instead, 
new ventures need to be as specific as possible about the precise attributes 
they are seeking. Technology start-ups tend to seek people who have strong 
technology expertise but also are flexible, and willing and able to assume a 
number of key roles in a new venture. The qualities of a good new member 
of a new venture include flexibility, experience, technical knowledge, and 
self-motivated creativity. The idea is to hire a “great athlete who has already 
run the race before.” Successful new enterprises also look for people who 
can thrive in environments in which people trust each other and are willing 
to debate assumptions, share information, and express their thoughts openly.
Perhaps the most important qualities of a new hire are proficiency in the 
skills required and demonstrated capability to acquire the attributes needed 
for future situations. Thus, a raw ability to learn is critical for technology ven-
tures [McCall, 1998]. Most new ventures benefit from attracting new people 
who possess stretchwork capabilities [Bechky and O’Mahony, 2006]. Stretch-
work is the capability to readily bridge from proven competencies to new 
ones demanded by the needs of the new venture. These people possess strong 
competencies and quickly learn new ones.
The growth and survival of an emerging business depends on both star 
players and good supporting talent [DeLong and Vijayaraghavan, 2003]. Star 
employees can make important contributions to performance. Yet a firm’s 
future also depends on the capable, steady performers. These steady perform-
ers bring stability and depth to an organization’s resilience. Furthermore, they 
are more likely to be loyal to the organization.

CHAPTER 12   The New Enterprise Organization272
Identifying, attracting, and retaining the best people can be difficult. To 
the extent possible, as a venture grows, it should recruit through existing team 
members and the firm’s supply chain. By clearly defining what the venture 
seeks in terms of crucial competencies and experience, the venture can run 
a more focused search for candidates who are more likely to be a strong fit 
[Fernandez-Araoz, 2005]. Ventures also should consider approaching the hir-
ing process as a “selling” process rather than a “buying” one. In other words, 
rather than focusing solely on screening applicants, they also should work to 
excite and entice potential employees. To be sure about the hire, new ventures 
often use a trial period in a consulting role or a temporary relationship on a 
project basis. Internships are common, too, and may turn into full-time posi-
tions if both the company and the employee see a fit.
Talented people in new ventures work hard and fast, trying to get to mar-
ket with the hope of big payoffs. They remain focused on the critical factors 
of success and resist any tendency to drift toward peripheral goals. They are 
motivated by significant responsibility, participation, and the possibility of big 
financial gains. Their internal commitment is, in fact, aligned with the reali-
ties of their incentives, and the potential results can be motivating. Although 
winning is important to them, the goal is to win as an enterprise, rather than as 
individuals. Venture capitalist John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins says that when he 
looks at the business plan, “I always turn to the biographies of the team first. 
For me, it’s team, team, team. Others might say, people, people, people—but 
I’m interested in the team as a whole” [Fast Company, 1997].
Attracting and retaining key employees depends on compensation, work 
design, training, and networks. Compensation systems include wages, incentives, 
and ownership options. New ventures need to provide reasonable compensation 
and benefits. People in a start-up may have to sacrifice financial compensation for 
an initial period while building the firm toward financial break-even. Thus, it is 
important to offer reasonable benefits and ownership opportunities. Offering health 
benefits may be necessary to attract people to the new venture. Most technology 
ventures offer health benefits to their employees before reaching break-even.
Ownership interest in the new firm will be of great interest to most new 
employees. Broad-based ownership, when done right, can lead to higher productiv-
ity, lower workforce turnover, better recruits, and improved outcomes [Rosen et al., 
2005]. Stock options are offered in a plan under which employees can purchase, at 
a later date, shares of the company at a fixed price (strike price). Stock options take 
on value once the market price of a company’s stock exceeds the exercise (strike) 
price. Stock options should vest with the recipient over a period of years. For exam-
ple, a new hire may receive an option for 10,000 shares exercisable at $1 per share 
vesting over four years. This is equivalent to 2,500 shares each year. Stock options 
give employees the right to buy the company’s stock in the future at a preset price, 
thus motivating them to work to increase  productivity and innovation—and eventu-
ally, the market value of the firm.
The purpose of employee stock options is to create a noncash substitute 
for part of the wage compensation the firm must provide to attract and retain 
bye23429_ch12_257-288.indd   272bye23429_ch12_257-288.indd   272 10/18/13   2:35 PM10/18/13   2:35 PM

employees. A new, entrepreneurial firm may not be able to provide the cash 
compensation needed to attract outstanding workers. Instead, it can offer stock 
options. From the beginning, Starbucks decided to grant stock options to every 
employee in proportion to their level of base pay: it called these options “bean 
stock.” Google created thousands of millionaires due to the issuance of wide 
stock options.
An alternative to stock options is restricted stock, which is stock issued 
in an employee’s name and reserved for his or her purchase at a specified price 
after a period of time—say, one, two, or three years. Some call this type of 
stock “reserved stock.” New firms need to increase the level of share ownership 
through such means as offering restricted shares and requiring that employees 
hold their shares for certain periods of time. For example, an employee could 
have 10,000 shares reserved to be purchased at $2 per share as they vest in 
two years. If the price of the stock appreciates to $10, the gain in the stock’s 
value is $80,000. Restricted stock still has value if the stock price falls, while 
options expire as worthless if the stock does not appreciate. In 2003, Microsoft 
switched from offering stock options to restricted stock.
Although compensation is an important means of attracting and retaining 
employees, a simple reliance on financial rewards is insufficient. Many, if not 
all, technology start-ups use an organizational design and culture that involves 
challenging work, peer group control, and selection based on specific task 
abilities. Few imperatives are more vital to the success of young technology 
companies than retaining key technical personnel, whose knowledge often 
represents the firm’s most valuable asset [Baron and Hannan, 2002]. There-
fore, the leaders of the enterprise need to maintain their commitments to their 
employees and retain their trust.
Keeping faithful, loyal employees and partners in a new venture can be 
based on six principles, as shown in Table 12.8 [Reichheld, 2001]. A sim-
ple reliance on financial rewards is insufficient. Good communication, trust, 
TABLE 12.8 Six principles for retaining loyal people and partners.
 1. Preach what you practice. Communicate the vision, goals, and values of the organization. 
Practice what you preach is also required.
 2. Partners must win also. Enable your vendors and partners to participate in a win-win 
venture.
 3. Be selective in hiring. Select people with values consistent with the firm’s. Membership 
on the team is selective.
 4. Use teams of talented people. Use small teams for most tasks and give them the power to 
decide. Provide simple rules for decision-making so teams can act.
 5. Provide high rewards for the right results. Reward long-term values and profitability. 
Provide solid compensation, benefits, and ownership.
 6. Listen hard, talk straight. Use honest, two-way communication and build trust. Tell 
people how they are doing and where they stand.

and treatment are essential to retaining talent and partners. High standards 
of decency, consideration, and integrity are necessary for all members of the 
new venture. Through loyalty to ideals, the firm becomes worthy of loyalty 
from its people and partners.
Intel, which has become the semiconductor standard for personal computers, 
uses three principles to keep its entrepreneurial spirit alive. First, leaders must 
be willing to solve complex problems. There is no substitute for deep domain 
knowledge in technology industries, and at Intel, new products are continually 
being released. Second, the most effective managers are not afraid to change 
the rules. The “Intel Inside” branding campaign was a highly unusual mar-
keting idea for a company with little previous direct contact with consumers. 
Last, Intel rarely tries to convince anyone to take a job or assignment. Manag-
ers must display a raw enthusiasm to try something new and a clear passion of 
their own [Barrett, 2003].
Intel: Staying Entrepreneurial
12.6 Organizational Culture and Social Capital
Organizational culture is the bundle of values, norms, and rituals that are 
shared by people in an organization and govern the way they interact with each 
other and with other stakeholders. An organization’s culture can have a power-
ful influence on how people in an organization think and act.  Organizational 
 values are beliefs and ideas about what goals should be pursued and what behav-
ior standards should be used to achieve these goals. Values include entrepre-
neurship, creativity, honesty, and openness.
Organizational norms are guidelines and expectations that impose appro-
priate kinds of behavior for members of the organization. Norms (informal rules) 
include how employees treat each other, flexibility of work hours, dress codes, 
and use of various means of communication such as e-mail.  Organizational 
 rituals are rites, ceremonies, and observances that serve to bind together mem-
bers of the organization. Examples of rituals are weekly gatherings, picnics, 
awards dinners, and promotion recognition.
In innovative firms, the values and beliefs favor collaboration, creativity, 
and risk-taking [Jassawalla and Sashittal, 2002]. These firms employ stories and 
rituals to reinforce these values and beliefs.
Culture is expressed in community. Communities are built on shared values, 
interests, and patterns of social interaction. The fit of the company culture in 
the business environment is critical to the company’s competitive advantage. 
Most entrepreneurial start-ups have the founders and employees bound together 
by strong values and norms that include long hours working closely together. 
The sense of solidarity of a new venture is very high. The goals are uniformly 
shared—survival and early success being foremost. Start-ups are often founded

12.6   Organizational Culture and Social Capital 275
by friends or former colleagues and exhibit high sociability within the orga-
nization. Employees possess a high sense of organizational identity and mem-
bership. In the early days, employees of Apple thought of themselves as “Apple 
people.” Entrepreneurial firms often sponsor social events that take on ritual 
significance.
Hewlett-Packard Company fostered a culture known as the “HP Way” 
[Packard, 1995]. This culture was captured in a statement of objectives, values, 
and norms regarding fairness and justice. Employees were promised opportunity 
for security, job satisfaction, and sharing in profit. For example, during the 1981 
recession, rather than lay people off, Hewlett-Packard introduced a 10 percent 
cut in pay and hours across every rank.
Zappos is known worldwide for its culture. The culture not only establishes 
a great organizational environment for employees to work in, but  also incor-
porates the way that Zappos interfaces with its customers. There are ten core 
Zappos values and they permeate the organization.   Employees are trusted 
to do the right thing and customers are also treated with a degree of trust 
that is unprecedented for an online retail establishment.  Every employee 
must spend his or her first three to four weeks working in the call center 
dealing with customer issues. Call center employees are empowered to do 
what is necessary to ensure customer satisfaction. Each manager at Zappos 
is expected to spend 10 to 20 percent of the time on employee team-building 
activities. The culture seems to be working: over 75 percent of sales at Zap-
pos comes from repeat customers.
Zappos: Enjoying Work
Entrepreneurial firms usually demonstrate high sociability and solidarity in 
their early years, built around the leadership of the founders—such as Hewlett 
and Packard. As the founders leave and other challenges come to bear, it may be 
difficult to retain the communal culture of a start-up. Yahoo built a fast-growing 
firm based on a set of founders who worked furiously at their jobs. Their com-
munal culture helped them build the firm, but their insularity may have made 
them see the marketplace through a Yahoo lens in 2000 [Mangalindan and 
Hoang, 2001]. Google has succeeded due in part to a powerful culture that is 
maintained at all of its locations worldwide. This helps develop a consistency in 
user experience that customers value.
Perhaps the strongest element of an organizational culture is trust [Covey, 
2006]. Trust is a firm belief in the reliability or truth of a person or an orga-
nization. It is critical that we can trust those with whom we work. Handy pro-
vides seven principles of trust, as listed in Table 12.9. Teams are formed with 
many people we already trust, but new members will need to earn our trust. 
By trust, organizations mean confidence in a person’s work, competence, and 
commitment to the organization’s goals and tasks. Every team member must

CHAPTER 12   The New Enterprise Organization276
be capable of self-renewal, learning, and adaptability. When trust is broken, the 
person needs to be reassigned, leave the organization, or have his or her bound-
aries constrained. Teams need to build bonds among their members to enable 
trust. People need to meet in person to restore the group bonds. Finally, orga-
nizations, like people, need to continually demonstrate that they are trustworthy.
Good communication is part of any sound and trusting community. Knowing 
when to speak up and when to keep silent is an important skill for any worker. A 
new enterprise needs openness and creativity to grow and become fruitful. Carefully 
choosing the right issues to raise and avoiding ill-chosen conflict can be important. 
When emotions are high and the new enterprise is challenged with obstacles, it may 
be wise to keep silent. Nevertheless, managers of any enterprise must welcome 
ideas and comments. Organizations of all sizes and arrangements must strive to 
keep the ideas flowing. Breaking the silence can bring an outpouring of fresh ideas 
from all levels of an organization—ideas that might just raise the organization’s 
performance to a whole new level [Perlow and Williams, 2003].
In a study of successful companies, the building of a performance-based 
culture was central [Joyce et al., 2003]. The study showed that winning 
TABLE 12.10  Four principles of a performance-based culture.
 1. Inspire everyone to do their best.
 2. Reward achievement with praise and pay-for-performance, and keep raising the perfor-
mance goals.
 3. Create a work environment that is challenging, rewarding, and fun.
 4. Establish, communicate, and stick to clear values.
Source: Joyce et al., 2003.
TABLE 12.9 Seven principles of trust.
 1. Trust is not blind. It is unwise to trust people whom you do not know well, whom you 
have not observed in action over time, and who are not committed to the same goals.
 2. Trust needs boundaries. It is wise to trust people in some areas of life but not necessarily 
in all.
 3. Trust requires constant learning. Every individual of a team must be capable of self-
renewal and learning.
 4. Trust is tough. When trust proves to be misplaced because people do not live up to 
expectations or cannot be relied on to do what is needed, then those people must go, be 
reassigned, or have their boundaries severely curtailed.
 5. Trust needs bonding. Teams of people need to build their own bonds.
 6. Trust needs touch. Personal contact is necessary, and teams need to meet in person to 
renew their trust and bonds.
 7.  Trust has to be earned. Organizations that expect their people to trust them must continu-
ally demonstrate that they are trustworthy.

12.6   Organizational Culture and Social Capital 277
Effective organizational design and culture, along with good hiring and 
retention processes, can enable a firm to grow its social capital. Social capital  
consists of the accumulation of active connections among people in a network 
[Coleman, 1990]. Social capital was also considered in Chapters 1 and 4. Social 
capital refers to the resources available in and through personal and organizational 
networks [Baker, 2000]. These resources include information, concepts, trust, 
financial capital, collaboration, social structure, and emotional support. These 
resources reside in networks of relationships. Social capital depends on whom you 
know. Social capital, like financial capital, can lead to increased productivity, if 
used wisely. A firm can build up or deplete its social capital by its actions. Rela-
tionship networks are often as important as technology, land, capital, or other 
assets of a venture.
Social capital tends to be self-reinforcing and cumulative. Successful collabo-
ration in one endeavor builds connections and trust—social assets that facilitate 
future collaboration in other, unrelated tasks. Firms that build up social capital dem-
onstrate a commitment to retaining people and promoting from within. They also 
enable far-flung teams to meet in person periodically. They give people a common 
sense of purpose and keep their promises to people. Employees need to hear the 
same messages that an organization sends out to vendors and customers. Alterna-
tively, social capital may be depleted by declining trust among a firm’s people and 
the effects of people working off-site or on their own [Prusak and Cohen, 2001].
companies built a culture on the four principles described in Table 12.10. Exam-
ples of  successful firms that have a performance-based culture include Intel, 
Cisco  Systems, and General Electric. Just about any high-potential firm needs to 
focus on performance, define it, and build a culture that reinforces it.
Leaders can develop a design for a workplace that can be fulfilling for 
all  involved. With growing trust and dignity as well as wide participation on 
decision-making, all employees can experience ownership and pleasure in their 
work [Bakke, 2005].
Cisco’s culture requires that all employees, at every level of the organization, 
are committed to responsible business practices. Additionally, our business 
strategy incorporates our dedication to corporate citizenship, which includes 
our commitment to improving the global community in which we operate, 
empowering our workforce, and building trust in our company as a whole.
Cisco was founded on, and still thrives today in, a culture based on the 
principles of open communication, empowerment, trust, and integrity. These 
values remain at the forefront of our business decisions. We express these 
values through ethical workplace practices; philanthropic, community, and 
social initiatives; and the quality of our people.

CHAPTER 12   The New Enterprise Organization278
Louis Gerstner joined IBM in January 1993 to bring the firm back to its roots 
and success. In his first months, Gerstner created a set of principles for the 
firm that included [Gerstner, 2002]:
■  At our core, we are a technology company with an overriding commitment to 
quality.
■ We operate as an entrepreneurial organization with a minimum of bureaucracy.
■ We think and act with a sense of urgency.
■  Outstanding, dedicated people make it all happen, particularly when they work 
together as a team.
Gerstner also described the IBM culture this way: “In the end, an organization 
is nothing more than the collective capacity of its people to create value.” By 
2002, Gerstner left IBM as a powerful technology company focused on its 
entrepreneurial principles.
IBM’s Guiding Principles
Social capital can be described as consisting of three dimensions: (1) structural, 
(2) relational, and (3) cognitive. The structural dimension concerns the over-
all pattern of relationships found in organizations. The relational dimension of 
social capital concerns the nature of the connections between individuals in an 
organization. The cognitive dimension concerns the extent to which employees 
within a social network share a common perspective or understanding [Bolino et 
al., 2002]. Social capital is valuable because it facilitates coordination, reduces 
transaction costs, and enables the flow of information between and among indi-
viduals. In other words, it improves the coordinated effort and organization.
Better knowledge sharing can lead to increased trust and better decisions. Team-
work can lead to inventiveness, creative collaboration, and a good spirit. Trust is the 
fuel of a social capital engine that in turn engenders more trust. When people in an 
organization say their firm is “political,” they often mean that trust is low throughout 
the organization. An organization with strong capital is a community with shared 
values and good trust. Moreover, social capital extends to relationships outside of the 
company, which should also be characterized by shared values and trust.
Managing to develop and utilize social capital can lead to enhanced corporate 
performance [Lee and Kim, 2005]. Providing the appropriate networks that enable 
creativity can improve quality and productivity. Engaging the creative energies in a 
collaborative activity of the technologists and designers with customers can lead to 
improved results [Florida and Goodnight, 2005]. Social capital can provide greater 
access to other resources [Kalnins and Chung, 2006]. Or, it can substitute where 
other types of capital are lacking [Packalen, 2007]. For most technology ventures, 
the social network should be dense and redundant, and link external and internal 
sources to needs [Cross et al., 2005]. Firms should continually adapt their social 
capital to changing resource needs [Maurer and Ebers, 2006].

12.7   Managing Knowledge Assets 279
12.7 Managing Knowledge Assets
Assets are potential sources of future benefit that a firm controls or can access. 
Knowledge is an asset that is a potential source of wealth, as described in 
 Chapter 1. The creation and management of knowledge leads to new, novel appli-
cations and products that can result in wealth creation.  Knowledge  is the aware-
ness and possession of information, facts, ideas, truths, and principles in an area 
of expertise.  Intellectual capital  is the sum of the knowledge assets of a firm. 
These knowledge assets include the knowledge of its people, the effectiveness of 
its management processes, the efficacy of its customer and supplier relations, and 
the technical knowledge that is shared among its people. It can be thought of as 
best practices, new ideas, synergies, insights, and breakthrough processes. Thus, 
the firm ’s intellectual capital (IC) is the sum of its human capital (HC), organiza-
tional capital (OC), and social capital (SC), as described in Chapter 1.  
From the generation of new ideas through the launch of a new product, 
the creation and exploitation of knowledge are core themes of the new product 
development process. In fact, the entire new product development process can 
be viewed as a process of embodying new knowledge in a product  [Rothaermel 
and Deeds, 2004].  
The knowledge creating and sharing activities of a firm can be represented 
by  Figure 12.3  [Leonard-Barton, 1995]. The value of commercial knowledge 
is in its use, not its possession. The value of knowledge compounds when it is 
shared. Using current knowledge for cooperative problem-solving is the first 
of the four knowledge activities of a firm. The second is the implementation of 
new processes and tools within the firm. The third activity is experimenting and 
learning in order to build the knowledge base. The fourth activity is  acquiring 
knowledge from outside the firm.   
As a result of creating and sharing knowledge, a firm can enhance its peo-
ple’s  skills and capabilities, as well as the knowledge embedded in its processes 
and managerial systems. Knowledge finds value in practice and use. The strate-
gic approach of a new venture is linked to a set of intellectual assets and capa-
bilities. Thus, if a firm has an opportunity that requires certain knowledge and it 
is not yet available, we can state that the firm has a knowledge gap. Acquiring 
the knowledge to fill the gap will be critical to the future success of this firm.  
The knowledge of a firm encompasses (1) cognitive knowledge (“know 
what”) or the basic mastery of a discipline, (2) advanced skills (“know how”) 
or the ability to apply knowledge to complex real-world problems, (3) system 
understanding and intuition (“know why”) or deep knowledge of cause-effect 
relationships, and (4) creativity (“care why”) or the will, motivation, and adapt-
ability for success. The first three forms of knowledge can be stored in the firm’s 
systems, databases, or operating technologies. The fourth form often is found in 
the firm’s culture [Quinn et al., 1996].  
Knowledge can be  prepositional,  which deals with beliefs about natural 
phenomena, such as scientific discoveries and practical insights into the prop-
erties of materials, waves, and nature.  Prescriptive  knowledge is all about

 techniques —the manipulation of processes and formulas, such as how to write a 
piece of software. The growing interplay between these two forms of knowledge 
transformed the world economy during the twentieth century [Mokyr, 2003].  
Knowledge can be seen as a source of innovation and change leading to 
action. Also, it provides a firm with the potential for novel action and the cre-
ation of new ventures. With increased flow of new information, firms need to 
develop the means to convert that information into insight [Ferguson et al., 
2005]. Knowledge creates real wealth for a new venture through multiple appli-
cations, which can have breadth across an organization. The knowledge rep-
resented by patented inventions, software, marketing programs, and skillful 
employees makes up 70 to 90 percent of the assets held by corporations like 
Microsoft, Amgen, and Intel.     
The growth of a new venture rests, in part, on the increasing value of a 
knowledge base within the emerging firm.  Knowledge management  is the 
practice of collecting, organizing, and disseminating the intellectual knowledge 
of a firm for the purpose of enhancing its competitive advantages. The four steps 
for managing knowledge in a new venture are given in  Table12.11 . The first 
step is to identify and evaluate the role of knowledge in the firm. How is knowl-
edge created, stored, and shared? The second step is to identify the expertise, 
 capabilities, and intellectual capital that create value for a firm. Then, we exam-
ine the uniqueness and value of these intellectual assets.

12.8   Learning Organizations 281
The third step is the creation of an investment and exploitation plan for 
maintaining and harvesting the value of the knowledge assets. Finally, the firm 
improves the process of creating and sharing its knowledge. Though knowledge 
is one of the few assets that grows when shared, the new  venture needs to care-
fully determine what knowledge to share and what knowledge should be pro-
tected or kept secret. This is particularly true for technology ventures for which 
intellectual property is usually their key asset.  
Part of an emerging firm ’s knowledge base is information about competi-
tors. This knowledge is useful in responding to competitive changes and chal-
lenges.  Competitive intelligence  is the process of legally gathering data about 
competitors. Competitor intelligence may include securing data about com-
petitors ’ products, services, channels of distribution, pricing policies, and other 
facts. Legal means of acquiring competitor intelligence include gathering com-
pany reports, news releases, and industry reports, and visiting competitor web-
sites and trade show booths.  
Knowledge is worthy of attention because it tells firms how to do things and 
how they might do them better [Davenport and Prusak, 1998]. The key skill for 
an emerging start-up is the ability to turn knowledge into products and services. 
Knowledge turns into action as it is embedded in the products, routines, pro-
cesses, and practices of the new technology venture. Knowledge embedded in a 
company ’s activities can be a sustainable competitive advantage since  imitating 
it is difficult for competitors.     
12.8 Learning Organizations   
New ventures grow powerful from learning and adapting to new challenges and 
opportunities. A  learning organization  is skilled at creating, acquiring, and 
sharing new knowledge and at adapting its activities and behavior to reflect new 
knowledge and insights. A technology venture creates and acquires knowledge and 
shares this knowledge among its people. As a result of this new knowledge, the 
organization adapts its actions and behavior. Learning organizations are skilled at 
five activities: systematic problem-solving, experimentation with new approaches, 
learning from their own experience and past history, learning from the experiences 
TABLE 12.11 Managing knowledge in a technology venture.       
 1. Role:    Identify and evaluate the role of knowledge in the firm.    
 2.  Value:     Identify the expertise, capabilities, and intellectual capital that create 
value in the form of products and services.    
 3. Plan:     Create a plan for investing in the firm ’s intellectual capital and exploiting 
its value while protecting it from leakage to competitors.    
 4.  Improve:     Improve the knowledge creation and sharing process within the new 
venture      .

and best practices of others, and transferring knowledge quickly and efficiently 
throughout the organization. The learning organization is active, imaginative, and 
participative. It attempts to shape its future rather than react to forces. A learning 
firm adapts itself to its learning and increases opportunities, initiates change, and 
instills in employees the desire to be innovative. A learning organization confronts 
the unknown with new hypotheses, tests them, and creates new knowledge. Thus, 
the learning organization creates innovation and new knowledge that is used by the 
technology venture to develop new products and services.  
Information that does not enable an action of some kind is not knowledge. 
Knowledge comes from the ability to act on information as it is presented. It truly 
is power, giving an organization the ability to continuously better itself. The power 
of knowledge depends on the company ’s ability to provide a supportive environ-
ment: a culture that rewards the sharing of knowledge across various barriers. The 
company that develops the right set of incentives for its employees to work col-
laboratively and share their knowledge will be successful in its knowledge man-
agement effort. Knowledge management has several benefits: it fosters innovation 
by encouraging a free flow of ideas, enhances employee retention rates, enables 
companies to have tangible competitive advantages, and helps cut costs.  
The decisions of an entrepreneurial firm are the result of the firm ’s ability 
to process knowledge and learning [Minniti and Bygrave, 2001]. Knowledge 
acquired through learning-by-doing takes place when entrepreneurs choose 
among alternative actions whose payoffs are uncertain. Over time, entrepreneurs 
repeat only those choices that appear most promising and discard the ones that 
resulted in failure. Thus, entrepreneurship is based on a process of learning that 
allows entrepreneurs to learn from successes as well as failures. Former CEO 
and Chairman of General Electric, Jack Welch, described the learning process 
thus:  “In the end I believe we created the greatest people factory in the world, a 
learning enterprise, with a boundary-less culture ”   [Welch, 2002].
Siemens, a global organization, uses the ShareNet network to enable 19,000 
technical specialists in 190 countries to help each other in solving problems. In 
one case, a project manager in South America was trying to find out how danger-
ous it was to lay cables in the Amazon rain forest in order to determine the type of 
insurance his project needed. He posed the question on ShareNet and within hours 
a project manager in Senegal who had encountered a similar situation responded. 
Getting the right,  actionable  information before the cables went underground saved 
the company several million dollars in insurance costs [Tiwana and Bush, 2005].  
Managers and entrepreneurs often have distorted pictures of their businesses 
and their environments. Busy among the trees, they can lose sight of the forest. 
They can review the impacts of their actions, however, and then modify their 
approach accordingly. The greatest asset that entrepreneurs can bring to knowl-
edge and learning is their willingness to seek and make wise use of feedback 
[Mezias and Starbuck, 2003].  
The entrepreneur ’s learning process is based on the six steps outlined in 
 Table 12.12  [Garvin, 1993]. At each stage in the development of the new busi-
ness, the entrepreneur encounters a set of challenges or problems that require

resolution. A firm can use the method shown in Figure 12.4 to resolve issues and 
learn from its successes and failures.   
Organizational learning looks at an organization as a thinking system. Orga-
nizations rely on feedback to adjust to a changing world. Thus, organizations 
engage in complex processes such as anticipating, perceiving, envisioning, and 
problem-solving in order to learn. This approach is very important for new tech-
nology ventures to adopt and improve.  
Process improvement projects can produce two types of learning.  Concep-
tual learning  is the process of acquiring a better understanding of cause-and-
effect relationships by using statistics and scientific methods to develop a theory. 
 Operational learning  is the process of implementing a theory and observing 
positive results. Conceptual learning yields know-why —the team understands 
why a problem happens. Operational learning yields know-how —the team 
has implemented a theory and knows how to apply it and make it work. It is use-
ful to design projects that are more likely to deliver both conceptual and opera-
tional learning [Lapre and Van Wassenhove, 2002].  
For learning to be widely used in a firm, knowledge must spread widely and 
quickly throughout the organization. Ideas carry maximum impact when they are 
shared broadly rather than retained by a few people. A variety of mechanisms 
enable this process, including written, oral, and visual reports, knowledge bases, 
personnel rotation programs, education, training programs, and formal and infor-
mal networks. The organization needs to foster an environment that is conducive 
to learning. The new venture must strive to set aside time for reflection and shar-
ing. Furthermore, boundaries that inhibit the flow of knowledge must be reduced 
so that learning is shared. A new venture can profit from efforts to eliminate bar-
riers that impede learning and to place learning high on the organizational agenda.

CHAPTER 12   The New Enterprise Organization284
Genmab was established in 1999 to develop products based on human anti-
bodies for the treatment of a number of life-threatening and debilitating diseases. 
The company was founded by Lisa Drakeman, who spotted the work of a Dutch 
scientist while working at another company. She proposed starting a company, 
but American venture capitalists were unwilling to invest. Genmab was thus 
founded in Copenhagen, with research facilities in the Netherlands. The com-
pany had its initial public offering in 2000. In 2008, its market value reached 
$2.5 billion as one of the world’s top 20 biotechnology firms. The venture cre-
ated powerful intellectual property (knowledge) via its learning processes. It 
then converted that value into financial assets through an IPO.
A learning organization, properly managed, can enable a firm to meet the chal-
lenge of change by constantly reshaping competitive advantage even as the mar-
ketplace rapidly shifts. The learning organization is able to improvise or adapt to 
balance the structure that is vital to meet budgets and schedules with flexibility 
that ensures the creation of innovative products and services that meet the needs of 
changing markets [Brown and Eisenhardt, 1998]. The firm that is most responsive 
to change and capable of learning is the one that succeeds [Galor and Moav, 2002].   
Knowledge is stored in documents, databases, and people ’s minds. Knowl-
edge created in a learning process as depicted in  Figure 12.4  is a social process that 
leads to increasing knowledge [McElroy, 2003]. Knowledge is shared by people 
and embedded within the business processes of the firm. Innovation flows through 
the business processes, products, and services of the firm, as shown in  Figure 12.4 . 
As the firm learns and creates new knowledge, new innovation is created and new 
opportunities are identified [Lumpkin and Lichtenstein, 2005].

In the early 1970s, the biotechnology industry was just beginning to emerge 
when Cetus was formed by Ronald Cape (a Ph.D. biologist with an MBA), 
Donald Glaser (Nobel laureate in physics), Peter Farley (a physician with an 
MBA), Calvin Ward (a scientist), and Moshe Alafi (a venture capitalist). Being 
one of the first firms in the industry and having the backing of a Nobel laureate, 
Cetus was able to attract a star-studded advisory board. Unfortunately, neither 
Cetus ’s employees nor its advisors knew what a biotechnology firm should look 
like or what it should do. Therefore, Cetus took money and formed partnerships 
with whoever was willing, and attempted to be all things to all people. The end 
result was that Cetus worked on projects that spanned from health sciences to 
agriculture to finding better processes for making industrial alcohol. In the early 
1980s, Cetus recognized that it needed to tighten its focus. It channeled 70 per-
cent of its R&D spending into the health care field, it brought in a professional 
manager to run the firm, and it was more forthright with analysts and the media. 
Unfortunately, by then, Cetus had lost many of its supporters and investors.  
Frustrated with Cetus ’s lack of direction and armed with their experi-
ence, several of the board members left Cetus to form their own biotechnol-
ogy companies. They were convinced —and investors appeared to agree —that 
a more focused strategy was a better way to go. One individual who was 
familiar with Cetus ’s business strategy was Robert Swanson, a young venture 
capitalist with Silicon Valley ’s Kleiner Perkins. In 1976, just five years after 
Cetus was founded, Swanson approached Herbert Boyer, then a professor at 
University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), about starting a new bio-
technology company based on work that Boyer had completed with Stanford 
University professor Stanley Cohen. What Boyer had scheduled as a 20-min-
ute polite conversation turned into a 3-hour meeting as Swanson won Boyer 
over with his enthusiasm. By the time Swanson and Boyer left the bar, they 
had agreed to form Genentech (for  “genetic engineering technology ”).  
Swanson left Kleiner Perkins and delved right into learning the science 
and becoming a hands-on, deeply involved CEO. Boyer also became deeply 
involved and took a leave of absence from UCSF. Swanson and Boyer 
worked hard to build a creative firm that was in many ways the antithesis of 
traditional pharmaceutical firms. To lure postdoctoral candidates away from 
academia, they offered their employees stock options and structured the 
R &D portion of their firm to resemble an  academic lab: scientists worked 
flexible hours, dressed casually, and were allowed to publish their research.  
In 1980, Genentech became the first biotechnology firm to go public, 
pricing its million shares at $35 each. Within half an hour of trading, the 
stock hit $89 per share and closed the day at $70. Genentech ’s public offer-
ing broke many previous IPO records. Today Genentech continues to be a 
well-managed learning organization.

Principle 12
Effective leaders coupled with a good organizational plan, a collabora-
tive, performance-based culture, and a sound compensation scheme can 
help align every participant with the goals and objectives of the new firm.
12.9 Spotlight on Intuit
Intuit provides software for personal finance, small business finance and 
accounting. These software products enable individuals and businesses to auto-
mate financial tasks. Formed in 1984, the firm went public in 1993. Revenues 
reached nearly $4 billion in 2012. 
Intuit has adopted a company-wide method of ongoing product reinvention. 
The company encourages all employees to find new opportunities. It has created 
an idea collaboration portal that lets employees share their concepts and receive 
support and suggestions. Intuit also fosters a culture of frugal experimentation. 
This fast experimentation method improves employee’s sense of ownership and 
cooperation, resulting in the examination of assumptions and feedback that can 
lead to company-wide success. With more experimentation, the fear of failure 
is reduced company-wide. As a result, the corporate culture supports continual 
reinvention, which has led to consistent year-to-year growth.
12.10 Summary
A new venture depends upon a team of people with complementary capabilities 
who are committed to a common goal. The team includes a board of directors and 
a board of advisors to help monitor and enhance the growing firm. Entrepreneurs 
should design an organization that facilitates effective coordination and collabora-
tion among these team members. The firm’s leaders strive to motivate and inspire 
the team members and to foster an innovative culture. As the firm grows, managers 
join to build the structure and carry out the detailed tasks of the new firm. The firm 
also puts together a compensation scheme that emphasizes “buy-in” or ownership—
normally achieved by awarding stock options or restricted stock. Effective organiza-
tions manage their knowledge assets carefully and strive to continually learn.

How can entrepreneurs efficiently acquire and 
organize the resources needed to launch their 
venture? 
T
o tap required resources, entrepreneurs 
need to build credibility and legitimacy in 
the  marketplace of resources and talent. 
Influence and persuasion can help entrepreneurs 
build their case for securing scarce resources for 
their venture.
Both choosing  a physical location and operat-
ing as a virtual organization are viable options for 
a firm today. We examine the benefits of joining 
a cluster of interconnected enterprises operating 
within a geographic region. All firms need to cre-
ate a plan for outsourcing functions while main-
taining critical functions within the firm. As firms 
strive to be innovative and competitive, they seek 
to control costs by outsourcing  functions to those 
who can do them better and cheaper. However, 
these firms are challenged to retain the cohesion 
and coordination required to effectively man-
age these supplier partners. Seeking financial 
resources will be discussed in Chapter 18.

CHAPTER 13   Acquiring and Organizing Resources290
Another definition of entrepreneurship is the pursuit of opportunity without 
regard to resources currently controlled [Stevenson et al., 1999]. This view 
stresses the idea that the entrepreneur can locate and access resources when they 
are needed. For example, when an entrepreneurial team needs legal counsel, it 
can engage a lawyer. When it needs a circuit designer, it can hire one. Resources 
are usually scarce, however, and the attraction of talented employees or finan-
cial investors is not easy or guaranteed. A firm’s competitive advantage flows 
from a combination of resources and capabilities executing a unique strategy. 
If these resources and capabilities are scarce, then the new venture needs to 
compete to secure them. 
The founders of a new venture attempt to acquire resources and capabilities by 
contacting key organizations and people and asking them to support their venture. 
For example, they ask their customers, suppliers, and sources of financial capital 
to take some risk and support the new venture, which will be further discussed in 
Chapter 18.
This resource-seeking activity can be represented by the cycle shown in 
 Figure 13.1 [Birley, 2002]. The founders are asking all the participants in the 
credibility cycle to believe in their opportunity, vision, and story, and invest in 
their venture. To move forward, entrepreneurs need to persuade someone in the 
cycle to believe in them. If the entrepreneurs get some talented people to com-
mit to the venture, this will help convince the suppliers. If the entrepreneurs get 
some customers to tentatively commit to purchasing the product, the sources of 
financial capital (bankers and investors) will become more interested. The entre-
preneurs travel around the cycle, slowly building their credibility. In other words, 
the entrepreneurs demonstrate the legitimacy or truthfulness of the new venture to 
the  members of the credibility cycle [Zimmerman and Zeitz, 2002]. Legitimacy

13.1   Acquiring Resources and Capabilities 291
or credibility is evidence of a social judgment of desirability and enables a new 
venture to access resources. The holders of scarce resources pro vide resources 
to new ventures only if they believe that the ventures are  efficient, worthy, and 
needed, and the teams are competent. The greater the level of a new venture’s 
legitimacy, the more resources it can access.
A new venture can build its legitimacy by tapping the sources of legiti-
macy listed in Table 13.1. A new venture can join industry associations, secure 
endorsements, and get commitments from talented, respected individuals. Pat-
ents, copyrights, and trade secrets also help to build legitimacy. New ventures 
should focus on actions that have the greatest payoff for legitimacy. A certain 
amount of legitimacy is required to make the credibility cycle build up the 
investment of resources. A successful new venture needs to acquire, build, and 
use legitimacy to secure the necessary resources to commence operations and 
grow successfully. Creating, building, and retaining a firm’s credibility or legiti-
macy are critical tasks for the leadership team of any business. They determine 
the key influencers in your industry and reach out to them about the opportunity. 
For example, it has been shown that attaining the support of credible and reputed 
venture capitalists results in increased credibility of the venture [Hsu, 2004]. The 
leadership team of a new venture recognizes and creates new economic or social 
opportunities and makes decisions on the location, form, and use of resources 
[Wennekers et al., 2002].
To the extent possible, smart leaders of ventures manage the new venture 
like it is a public company [Carl, 2007]. They manage it with the idea that it will 
grow to become an important enterprise eventually. They hire a highly qualified 
law firm and accountant. They look for the best employees and talent available, 
including compelling board members and advisors. A new venture should strive 
to be one of the best from the beginning.
Entrepreneurs who exhibit higher social competencies and emotional intelli-
gence greatly improve their ability to access resources. Entrepreneurs possessing 
a high level of social capital (e.g., a favorable reputation and an extensive social 
network) gain access to persons important for their success. Once such access 
is attained, their social competence influences the outcomes they experience 
[Baron and Markman, 2003].
In order to attract resources, entrepreneurs craft and use a story about their 
venture that they tell to potential partners and visitors [Downing, 2005]. In

CHAPTER 13   Acquiring and Organizing Resources292
Influence and persuasion play a role in the entrepreneur’s acquisition of 
resources. They are part of the process of selling, acquiring resources, and struc-
turing deals regarding acquisitions and investments. Every entrepreneurial team 
ideally needs a person who is a master of persuasion [Cialdini, 1993]. Persua-
sion skills can often influence the behavior of others more than formal power 
relationships.
Persuasion is governed by basic principles that can be taught, learned, and 
applied [Cialdini, 2008]. The six principles of persuasion appear in Table 13.2. 
The principle of liking states that people like to please or work with those who 
sincerely like them also. One can uncover shared interests and bonds and offer 
sincere praise and compliments.
The second principle of reciprocity states that one can elicit the desired 
behavior from others by displaying it first. Offering help or information to oth-
ers first can encourage them to reciprocate. The third principle of social proof  
states that people look for and respond to a display of endorsements from those 
they trust.
The fourth principle of consistency states that people stick to their verified 
commitments—those they make as voluntary, public statements. People who 
make verbal public or written commitments are likely to stay with them. The 
fifth principle of authority states that people highly regard experts. Therefore, it 
is useful to show and display your firm’s expertise and competencies.
Finally, the principle of scarcity states that people want scarce or unique 
products. Therefore, it is necessary to explain and demonstrate the unique ben-
efits and the chance to gain exclusive advantages. 
addition, they can use advisors and guides to help them in building their cred-
ibility and story [Chrisman et al., 2004].
Aaron Levie founded Box in March 2006 to provide low-cost, cloud-
based storage for documents and other content, as well as the ability to 
sync and use documents across a spectrum of devices, including desk-
top computers, laptops, and smartphones. Initially aimed at consumers, 
he quickly realized that Box could be sold to businesses as well. Sell-
ing to enterprises required significant capital. As of January 2013, Levie 
had raised $312 million in capital from private investors, venture capital 
firms, private equity firms, and other companies who were strategic part-
ners of Box.

As mobile telephony grew in prominance during the last several decades, 
the giant telecommunications companies invested in infrastructure world-
wide. In this spurt of development, Africa was largely ignored due to its 
widespread instability, corruption, and poverty. Companies that attempted 
to do business in Africa faced the unpleasant reality that bribes were often a 
prerequisite to conducting business. In 1998, Mo Ibrahim, a consultant with 
experience in African telecom companies, saw this as an opportunity.
Mo founded Celtel, which is a mobile phone service provider, and took 
an especially effective approach to doing business. Rather than targeting 
individual African markets, he eliminated inefficiencies by widening the 
scale of operations to a pancontinental level. This large scale also increased 
the respectability and political clout of Celtel, allowing him to operate with-
out paying bribes. In this way, Mo was able to utilize the positive forces of 
influence to achieve his goals rather than resorting to immoral pecuniary 
incentives.

13.3 Location and Cluster Dynamics
Choosing a location can have long-lasting effects on a new venture. Entrepre-
neurs need to choose their location with their customers, future employees, sup-
pliers, partners, and competitors in mind. While the importance of location to 
start-ups in the retail and restaurant businesses is obvious, location is impor-
tant to all companies. Criteria for location selection are listed in Table 13.3. 
Knowledge-based enterprises, especially, need to locate in an area where skilled 
employees and complementors are readily available. The cost of doing business 
will be an important factor in location selection, too. Furthermore, housing that 
is affordable to all employees is important. A company’s home should be a place 
that current and future employees will like. Thus, it should have good schools, a 
feeling of safety, and good transportation links.
Location advantages are based on the flow of knowledge, relationships, 
and access to institutions. Commonly known ideas and technologies that can be 
accessed from anywhere will be widely available to all competitors. Thus, they 
cannot serve as a competitive advantage. Local advantages, such as access to 
knowledge and research at a university, therefore can become a unique advan-
tage [Audretsch et al., 2005]. It is important for companies to be physically near 
some key constituents [Weterings and Boschma, 2009]. These constituents include 
 customers, competitors, suppliers, and other companies in related fields, as well 
as venture capital firms. Moreover, ventures that are launched in regions in which 
their founders have lived longer tend to perform better [Dahl and Sorenson, 2012].
Companies should attempt to proactively link into strong local institutions 
such as trade associations, universities, and professional societies. Entrepreneurs 
should take advantage of opportunities in their local region. Long-term competi-
tive advantage relies on being able to avoid imitation by competitors. Location-
based advantages in innovation may prove more sustainable than implementing 
corporate best practices [Porter, 2001]. 
Firms in industrial regions benefit from localization of cost economies 
derived from specialist suppliers, a specialist labor pool, and the spread of local 
knowledge [Best, 2001]. Since new ventures benefit from new knowledge, 
competent suppliers, and available talent, they should consider locating in a 
region that offers easy access to all three factors. Entrepreneurial activity differs 
significantly across regions of a country. Examples of attractive locations for 
new ventures are provided in Table 13.4.

13.3   Location and Cluster Dynamics 295
A cluster is a geographic concentration of interconnected companies in a 
particular field. Clusters can include companies, suppliers, trade associations, 
financial institutions, and universities active in a field or industry. A good exam-
ple is the Hollywood cluster of firms and infrastructure coming together for the 
creation of movies. If a new venture wants to enter the movie industry, it is prob-
ably wise to consider locating in Los Angeles.
An excellent example of an emerging cluster is Israel’s high technol-
ogy cluster, often called “Silicon Wadi.” In 2012, venture capitalists invested 
$867 million in Israel, much of which went to companies based in this cluster. 
Although this is only a fraction of that spent in Silicon Valley, the cluster is 
growing rapidly. It provides an environment conducive to technology venture 
formation: elite universities, venture capital firms, research centers run by big 
corporations, and a location attracting talented engineers.
A start-up can gain regional advantages by joining a cluster of companies 
that have complementary or competitive capabilities and resources. A new 
 company within a cluster is more likely to find the employees and infrastructure 
that it needs [Iansiti and Levien, 2004]. Firms located in clusters have better 
product innovation performance, sales growth rates, and survival rates. In gen-
eral, good clusters provide access to ideas, role models, informal forums, and 
sources of talent [Gilbert et al., 2008].
Clusters promote both competition and cooperation. Firms form alliances, 
recruit each other’s talent, and compete, all at the same time. A cluster also pro-
vides new firms with a critical mass of talent, knowledge, and suppliers for easy 
entry into an industry. A cluster of independent and informally linked companies 
and institutions represents a robust organizational form that offers advantages in 
efficiency, effectiveness, and flexibility.
Furthermore, clusters are conducive to new business formation for a variety 
of reasons. First, barriers to entry are lower than elsewhere. Second, individuals 
working within a cluster can more easily perceive gaps in products or services 
around which they can build businesses. Finally, the formation of new ven-
tures creates market opportunities for others. For example, a new venture may

introduce a new product that creates the possibility of complementary products 
offered by other local enterprises.
The availability of firms providing complementary products may be criti-
cal to a new venture’s success. In a tourism cluster, such as New York City, the 
quality of a visitor’s experience depends not only on the appeal of the primary 
attraction but also on the quality and efficiency of complementary businesses 
such as hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, and transportation systems. Because 
members of the cluster are mutually dependent, good performance by one can 
improve the success of the others.
The area south of San Francisco called Silicon Valley is a cluster for elec-
tronics, medical devices, green tech, and Internet companies. Connec tedness 
and mobility of talent and ideas are a way of life in Silicon Valley. The sup-
port structure includes entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, attorneys, consul-
tants, board members, universities, and research centers. Technology firms in 
Silicon Valley prosper in a dynamic environment of novelty and innovation. 
This network environment is the outcome of collaborations between individ-
ual entrepreneurs, firms, and institutions focused on the pursuit of innovation 
and its commercialization. Silicon Valley has an openness to change and is 
supportive of the creative and the different [Florida, 2002]. It displays all of 
the cluster characteristics that support innovation, as listed in Table 13.5.
The entrepreneurial attitude prevalent in Silicon Valley is exemplified by the 
views of T. J. Rogers, founder of Cypress Semiconductor, who said [Malone, 2002]:
What makes us special and different here in Silicon Valley is that we’re 
truly capitalists. We invest. There is no safety net. You can go out of busi-
ness. You can crash into the wall. There are companies, you can count them 
on both hands every day, that go out of business, and that’s life.
Dynamic, growing industrial regions are constantly upgrading their capa-
bilities and resources, and commercializing innovations. A cluster’s boundaries 
may be defined by the totality of the industry participants and may reach across 
political boundaries. Regional clusters can be a virtuous circle leading to better 
opportunities, more venture capital, increasingly educated talent, and more suc-
cess. The cluster of independent activities can engender dynamic flows of cost 
reductions and competitive advantage.

13.4   Vertical Integration and Outsourcing 297
Once the entrepreneur chooses the city or region of location, the next task is 
to find a suitable facility. A building must fit the needs of the organization and 
allow for expansion as the firm grows. For most new ventures, leasing space 
in an existing facility is the most economic choice. For some more established 
firms, owning rather than renting can pay off. However, most start-ups need to 
use their financial resources for innovation and marketing.
Finally, entrepreneurs should carefully consider the layout within their 
facility. A layout is the arrangement of the facility to provide a productive 
workplace. This can be accomplished by aligning the form of the space with its 
use or function. Today’s facilities have replaced the private office and laboratory 
with public spaces and open-plan areas without walls. Since innovation is, in part, 
a social or collaborative activity, the work spaces are laid out to host team activ-
ity. New ventures are best started in an open facility with few walls and doors in 
order to promote collaboration. Studies have shown that communication between 
people declines at a rate inversely proportional to the distance between them. For 
example, we are five times more likely to communicate with someone who sits 
six feet away as we are with someone who sits 60 feet away [Allen, 2000]. Thus, 
a firm needs to avoid separate facilities for as long as possible. The center of the 
facility might be a public area with a coffee bar and meeting tables. The goal is to 
design the facility for flexibility and collaboration.
13.4 Vertical Integration and Outsourcing
New ventures normally have limited financial resources and are unable to inter-
nally provide all the functions required for operation of all activities. One way 
to identify resources and activities that have the potential for creating competi-
tive advantages for a firm is to consider the value chain. The value chain of a 
firm is a sequence of business activities for transforming inputs into outputs that 
customers value, as depicted in Figure 13.2. The issue for the new venture is to 
decide which of the activities on the value chain will be accomplished by the 
firm and which activities will be provided by other firms (outsourced). A new 
or emerging firm will necessarily focus on a few of the activities on the value 
chain and outsource the others. Vertical integration is the extent to which a 
firm owns or controls all the value chain activities of a business.
In this chapter, we discuss the value chain and the decision to outsource or 
retain an activity within the firm. In Chapter 14, we return to the value chain 
and discuss how to manage and operate it to attain a competitive advantage.
The decision by a new venture to choose to carry out a value chain activity 
can be based on four questions, shown in Table 13.6 [Barney, 2002]. The deci-
sion to focus on a few value chain activities can be aided by an analysis of the 
four issues: (1) value, (2) rarity, (3) ability to be imitated, and (4) mission and 
organization. In many cases, it may be necessary to extend the activities of a firm 
to control a specific activity on the chain, especially when the firm affirmatively 
answers all four questions of Table 13.6.

CHAPTER 13   Acquiring and Organizing Resources298
Many companies are operating in a hypercompetitive global market where 
there is overcapacity in most industries. In such an environment, they are being 
called upon to achieve profitability by relentless cost cutting. This often entails 
heavy outsourcing to lower-cost labor and moving business abroad.
If a firm decides to outsource an activity, it plans on gaining a cost advantage 
or access to the supplier’s superior competency or economy of scale [Weigelt and 
Sarkar, 2012]. Access to a supplier’s superior competency and cost advantage may 
be favorable. For example, a new venture cannot offer its employees a superior, 
low-cost, internally operated cafeteria and food service. When it is cheaper and 
easier to conduct an activity internally, then new ventures may consider taking it 
on. The best reason, however, to carry out an activity on the value chain is that it is 
strategically critical to a firm’s success. Typically, product design and marketing 
cannot be outsourced since they are critical to the success of most new technology 
ventures.
A new venture in the personal computer business may choose to con-
trol product design and marketing while outsourcing the other functions after 
answering the four questions of Table 13.6. On the other hand, a packaged food 
business would probably attempt to control all product design, manufacturing, 
and marketing functions while relying on other firms to provide the technology 
development, distribution, and service activities [Aaker, 2001].
As companies outsource more functions, the scope for competitive differ-
entiation narrows. Almost all routine activities are of low value, not rare,  easily 
imitated, and not central to the mission of a firm. Thus, most new ventures 
 outsource routine services such as payroll, accounting, and other administrative 
services. The transaction costs of managing outsourced services have recently 
declined, thanks to cheaper communication and the standardization of Web-
based tools. Managing a relationship with a strategically important outsourcing 
agent is far more complex than coping with an ordinary supplier. In many cases, 
a partnership arrangement with a critical outsourcing agent is required. Reasons 
for failure of outsourcing include poor contracts, poor control of the function, 
and not planning for a termination strategy [Barthelemy, 2003]. Failures can be 
avoided or managed if accountability for managing the outsourced functions is 
clearly assigned to one or two persons in the new venture.
TABLE 13.6  Questions for selecting value chain activities that will be car-
ried out by the new venture firm.
 1. Value Is the activity a primary source of product value for the firm?
 2. Rarity Does the activity include a resource or capability controlled
 by the firm and rarely available to competing firms?
 3. Ability to be imitated Do competing firms have a cost disadvantage when imitating
 the scarce resource or capability held by the new venture
 firm?
 4. Organizational mission Is the activity critical to the mission of the firm, and is the 
 firm organized to exploit this valuable, rare, and costly-to-
 imitate resource or capability? bye23429_ch13_289-306.indd   298bye23429_ch13_289-306.indd   298 10/24/13   9:51 AM10/24/13   9:51 AM

13.4   Vertical Integration and Outsourcing 299
Transaction costs with suppliers and customers can be the most important 
types of costs. Transaction activities are time-consuming and prone to errors. 
Thus, companies use technology to automate their purchasing and contracting 
transactions with their suppliers and providers. Discount broker Charles Schwab 
& Company entered the securities brokerage market by offering a transaction 
cost advantage for both its customers and suppliers. Another firm that offers 
lower transaction costs to its customers and suppliers is FedEx [Spulker, 2004].
Although a new venture should consider outsourcing many of its activities, out-
sourcing can lead to problems. If an activity is outsourced and the supplier fails to 
deliver the required result (or activity) on time and with the required performance, 
the new venture can experience great difficulties. The conditions that favor the 
internalization of the activity within the new venture are summarized in Table 
13.7. If the demand forecast for an activity or component is highly uncertain, it 
may be better to do the task internally. If there are only a few, powerful suppliers 
of a service or component, the danger is that they might use their power and not 
meet the required needs at the agreed-upon cost and time. If a firm’s technology is 
valuable and proprietary, it may decide to keep it internal for reasons of secrecy.
Sometimes firms are led to outsource those value-added functions in which 
most of their profits will be made in the future. In the struggle for a sustainable 
competitive advantage, it is important to retain these value-added functions that 
will be critical to the firm’s advantage in the future [Brown, 2005].
Henry Ford built a vertically integrated facility at River Rouge near Detroit 
in 1917. The self-reliant plant made steel for auto bodies as well as all parts from 
engines to windshields. From Ford’s own forests came wood for the  paneling. For 
Ford, integration meant control of all the activities. A new firm cannot afford this 
type of vertical integration. It is too expensive and too risky. It is risky because 
with vertical integration comes control and commitment to a large investment in 
one way of doing things. Loss of flexibility is risky in a continuously changing 
economy. Today, Ford Motor Company is responsible only for the design, assem-
bly, and marketing of its vehicles. All the modules and parts are provided by an 
array of suppliers and partners. In the near future, automobile companies may do 
only the core tasks of designing, engineering, and marketing vehicles. Everything 
else, including final assembly, may be done by the parts suppliers.

CHAPTER 13   Acquiring and Organizing Resources300
The online grocery service offers important lessons in the challenges and 
rewards of vertical integration. Webvan was founded in 1999 to offer an exten-
sive line of grocery and nongrocery items for selection online with delivery to the 
customer’s door. Following several rounds of venture capital investments and an 
initial public offering, Webvan offered same-day delivery in several cities. To 
provide this ser vice, Webvan found it necessary to build distribution centers. 
Webvan hoped to minimize costs by setting up a string of futuristic, $35 mil-
lion warehouses with motorized carousels and robotic product-pulling machines. 
The cost of its delivery fleets, however, was enormous. With margins as low as 
2 percent, Webvan struggled to make a profit. After burning its way through more 
than $1.2 billion, Webvan closed its doors in July 2001. Webvan failed because it 
had a flawed business model that required a large investment in expensive distri-
bution and service activities, as shown on the value chain of Figure 13.2.
Tesco of Britain, by contrast, offers an online grocery service that is profit-
able. Tesco used a new channel, the Internet, to reach its existing customers 
as well as new ones. Tesco provided online ordering combined with customers 
picking up their selected and boxed groceries at a Tesco store or paying a deliv-
ery charge. Tesco used existing stores, while Webvan built new warehouses and 
extensive delivery services. This illustrates why efficient operations along the 
value chain are critical to profitability.
Salesforce.com uses the “software-as-a-service” model as an application 
service provider (ASP). The firm offers software for “rent” that is delivered 
to customers online through a Web browser [Clark, 2003b]. Salesforce.com 
rents software online that companies use to manage their salespeople and 
lets other software developers rent out their software using its computers. 
This is a novel idea. One obstacle to this service is that most corporations do 
not want sensitive information stored on any computer other than their own. 
Should a start-up firm use this outsourcing service?
Salesforce.com’s Outsourcing Model
13.5 Innovation and Virtual Organizations
A virtual organization manages a set of partners and suppliers linked by the 
Internet, fax, and telephone to provide a source or product. In this case, the value 
provided by the company is primarily the networking of the participating part-
ners and outsourcing agents. This value, however, is often not rare and can be 
readily imitated.
Amazon.com now operates the online stores and fulfillment activities of the 
online operations of Target, Toys-R-Us, and Circuit City. Amazon has become 
an outsourcing agent of Web services, logistics, and  customer service for brick-
and-mortar giants. GSI Commerce (www.gsicommerce.com) is an outsourcing 
company that operates e-commerce businesses for 25 sports retailers, including

Sports Authority and the Athlete’s Foot. Global Sports owns the  merchandise 
and manages inventory, fulfillment, and customer service. Each retailer, in turn, 
receives a single-digit percentage cut of any revenues that come from its site. 
To consumers, it just looks like they’re buying from their local retailer. Global 
Sports relieves the retailers of the burden of building and maintaining costly 
e-commerce infrastructure. Moreover, because Global Sports bears all the costs, 
it allows a client’s  e-commerce operations to be profitable from day one. Global 
Sports, in turn, makes money because of the scale of its business. Moreover, 
Global Sports spends nothing on advertising and marketing. The retailers take 
care of that activity.
Companies using outsourcing and networks can pull together resources to 
address specific projects and objectives without having to build permanent orga-
nizations. Virtual organizations use computers and networks to build an inte-
grated system. Software applications can be “rented” from an application service 
provider (ASP), for example.
As a U.S. startup, [24]7 Customer received $22 million in its first round of 
venture capital from Sequoia Capital in 2003. The firm initially catered to 
U.S. corporations that wanted to outsource backoffice operations to India. It 
now provides customer service and technical support via the Internet from 
India and other countries. [24]7 Customer is now profitable with over 8,000 
employees. [Vogelstein, 2003]. (See  www.247-inc.com.)
[24]7 Customer: An Example of Outsourcing
New innovative firms can access new ideas from an “idea” marketplace 
through licensing, alliances, and renting (subscriptions). Flexible, dynamic firms 
know that the best ideas are not always within their own boundaries. Importing 
new ideas is a good way to multiply the building blocks of innovation [Rigby 
and Zook, 2002]. Furthermore, more companies are willing to  outsource their 
ideas and technologies to serve this market.
The creation of virtual organizations brings several challenges with it. Vir-
tual firms encounter difficulty in building trust, coordination, and cohesion 
among the partner firms and outsource suppliers. New ventures need to invest 
time and resources in the task of keeping the coordination, trust, and synergy 
active in a virtual firm [Kirkman et al., 2002].
13.6 Acquiring Technology and Knowledge
For many firms, the effective use and management of the outsourcing  function 
can be a competitive advantage. An open-architecture value chain can be a 
powerful business model [Moore, 2000]. The prudent use of other firms

that provide significant contributions to a given need can be productive. For 
example, an electronic system might be built with an Intel microprocessor, 
Micron memory, and EMC storage, assembled by Solectron, and distributed 
by Ingram.
The new venture needs to identify which tasks are core and which are 
context. A task is core when its outcome directly affects the firm’s compet-
itive advantage. Everything else is context [Gottfredson et al., 2005]. The 
core/context ratio is a direct measure of effectiveness at generating share-
holder value.
The asset base that a firm seeks to leverage through entrepreneurship has 
shifted over the past decade. The key assets are no longer plants and physical 
assets but instead are technology, science, and knowledge [Hill et al., 2002]. 
Entrepreneurs strive to see where new products have become feasible due to 
the availability of new technologies. With the advent of the new technologies, 
such as genomics, entrepreneurs see the opportunity for important new medical 
drugs, for example.
New enterprises also need to import leverage and recombine knowledge 
bases. Imported knowledge bases can include licensed technologies, purchased 
technologies, and knowledgeable employees.
A new technology venture will have developed or acquired a basic new 
technology. This new technology will, it hopes, be the basis for develop-
ing and contributing to countless products for many industries. For exam-
ple, a new venture may possess powerful competencies and knowledge in 
the science and technology of superconductors. This new technology venture 
would look for applications in the electric power industry and the electronics 
industry.
The success of the embodiment of any new basic technology depends on seven 
characteristics, as shown in Table 13.8 [Burgelman, 2002]. These categories or 
characteristics are useful because they apply in all industries. For example, a pow-
erful new superconducting technology might provide superconductivity of metal at 
a low initial cost to semiconductor manufacturers and be easy to use in integrated 
circuits with very low operating costs, highly-reliable operation and serviceability, 
and high compatibility with normal circuits. In this case, we would have a very 
powerful new technology for the electronics industry.

13.7   Spotlight on Netflix 303
13.7 Spotlight on Netflix 
Netflix Inc. is a provider of DVDs by mail and of on-demand streaming media. 
The company was incorporated in 1997 and has its headquarters in Los Gatos, 
California. Today, Netflix offers its 50 million members access to a collection of 
more than 100,000 titles. Netflix’s competitors include Amazon, Dish Network, 
Comcast and Hulu. 
Netflix has acquired resources and capabilities continuously, as described 
by Figure 13.1. Its location in Silicon Valley enables it to take advantage of 
cluster dynamics through the availability of employees and proximity to firms 
with complementary resources. Netflix also outsources some functions, such as 
the delivery of DVDs. 
In the highly-competitive market for streaming media, Netflix has attempted 
to acquire and employ new technologies. In 2013, it announced $100,000 in 
prizes to architects and developers who make improvements in cloud technology.
One of the most active purchasers of technology is Cisco Systems. Between 
1993 and 2012, Cisco acquired 159 high-tech companies. Many of these 
acquisitions were made in 1999 and 2000. During this period, entrepreneurs 
would talk of founding companies in hopes that they would be acquired by 
Cisco. Although the number of acquisitions that Cisco made dropped dra-
matically, purchasing nascent technology remains an important part of its 
growth strategy.
To facilitate the often arduous task of integrating the acquired firm, 
Cisco developed and used a documented template that focused on integrat-
ing both the people and the technology. Cisco thought carefully about who 
it would acquire, often taking months to make the decision. The firm did 
not believe in hostile takeovers and usually acquired geographically proxi-
mate companies with “market congruent” visions. Cisco preferred com-
panies that were old enough to have a first product but still young enough 
that they were not entrenched in their ways or enmeshed with a broad base 
of customers. Second, Cisco had a no-layoff policy and made a point of 
keeping the acquired firm’s staff. In the late 1990s, Cisco’s turnover rate 
for acquired employees was well below 5 percent, and senior executives 
were often folded into Cisco’s senior ranks.
On the technology side, the R & D and product organizations were 
integrated with Cisco’s other products and immediately labeled with the 
Cisco brand. In addition, any nonstandard technology was eliminated 
from the acquired firm, and its employees were given immediate access to 
Cisco’s own infrastructure and core applications. The result was that most 
of Cisco acquisitions were fully integrated within 60 to 100 days.

CHAPTER 13   Acquiring and Organizing Resources304
Principle 13
Effective new ventures use their persuasion skills, credibility, and loca-
tion advantages to secure the required resources for their firm in order 
to build a well-coordinated mix of outsourced and internal functions.
13.8 Summary
Successful entrepreneurs are good at locating and acquiring the resources they 
need to start and build their firm. They need capital, people, and intellectual and 
physical assets to launch and grow their business. They do this by building cred-
ibility and legitimacy with the sources of these scarce resources. Typically, they 
are good at telling persuasive stories about their vision and its potential. They 
use their skills of persuasion to acquire the required resources in a timely way.
Entrepreneurs also create a plan for outsourcing some functions while 
retaining critical functions, such as product design and marketing. They use the 
Internet to help communicate and manage their relationships with their partners 
and suppliers in a virtually integrated firm.

Management of Operations
Real intelligence is a creative use of knowledge, not merely an accumulation of facts.
D. Kenneth Winebrenner
How do new firms build a set of operational 
processes that serve to create, make, and pro-
vide the product to the customer? 
M
ost businesses build a chain of activi-
ties that add value at each section of the 
chain. Each element of the value chain 
has a capability that provides value added to the 
product. A new venture manages its value chain to 
provide the ultimate product to the customer. The 
firm also moves, stores, and tracks parts and mate-
rials to its value-adding partners and strives to 
ensure timely, efficient production of the service 
or product. Information flow along the value chain 
enables the coordination of the distributed tasks. 
An effective enterprise manages for operational 
excellence by trying to develop and communicate 
measurements of efficiency and timeliness.
Using the Internet and related technologies, new 
enterprises can build a powerful virtual organization.   
The Internet can be used to communicate with a set 
of partners in a quick and effective manner. This 
set of partners can work from a common schedule, 
manage how jointly assigned tasks are allocated, and 
see how interdependencies impact a common sched-
ule. Interrelated tasks can be better managed across 
firms, which results in better forecasting and stron-
ger chances of achieving on-time production.

14.1 The Value Chain
As discussed in Chapter 13, the purpose of a firm is to provide products that custom-
ers value. A value chain is a series of activities for transforming inputs into outputs 
that customers value. Each value chain activity adds value, as shown in Figure 14.1. 
Information flows back from the customer and the sales and ser vice activities so 
that the value chain can maximize value for the customer. More than merely things 
with features, products are increasingly viewed as things with features bundled 
with services. Products and services are grounded in activities and relationships 
in a value-creating system. Furthermore, each element of the value chain has cer-
tain capabilities that can be improved over time. Capability development along the 
chain and the design of the chain can lead to a powerful core competency for a new 
venture. Furthermore, customers participate in this value-creating process by com-
municating their preferences and priorities. Understanding the customer enables the 
producer to better match the customer’s needs, as described in Table 14.1.
A highly integrated company provides most, if not all, of the functions along 
a value chain. This approach is most suitable when proprietary interdependent 
activities occur at each stage of the chain. As many industries mature, the func-
tions along the chain become independent so that modular subproducts are avail-
able at each stage. At that point in time, the value chain breaks up, and a number 
of independent firms participate in the activity chain. For example, today’s 
 automakers are adopting modular architectures for their mainstream models. 
Rather than putting together individual components from diverse suppliers, they 
are procuring subsystems from fewer suppliers. The architecture within each 
subsystem (braking, steering, chassis) is becoming progressively more interde-
pendent as these suppliers strive to meet the auto assembler’s performance and 
cost demands [Christensen et al., 2001].
Every industry has its own rate of evolution that erodes its competitive advan-
tage. In a fast-changing industry, a firm must have the ability to readily rede-
sign its value chain to find new sources of competitive advantage [Fine et al., 
2002]. In designing or redesigning a value chain, each stage of the value chain 
can be assigned an economic value-added measure (EVA), which accounts for 
knowledge assets and strategic assets. Strategic assets are those in which the firm 
has relative competitive advantage. Strategic assets may include logistics, man-
ufacturing, and distribution assets. Knowledge assets will exist primarily in the 
research design, marketing, and service functions. A new firm should retain the 
bye23429_ch14_307-328.indd   308bye23429_ch14_307-328.indd   308 10/24/13   9:52 AM10/24/13   9:52 AM

## Page 332

14.1   The Value Chain 309
functions with high EVA and outsource functions with low EVA. If the industry is 
changing rapidly, however, a firm may decide to retain a key function to strategi-
cally respond to the change internally. Often a sound approach is to retain the high 
EVA activities and key strategic assets while outsourcing the low EVA activities.
Vertical integration along the value chain provides firms with an opportunity to 
choose the value-added stages in which it will compete. Intel is a manufacturer of 
both integrated circuits and circuit boards, but it also assembles personal computers 
under an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) agreement with PC companies.
Zara, a European clothing retail firm with 1,000 stores, has retained its 
manufacturing capability rather than outsourcing it so it can respond quickly to 
changing fashion demands. Other firms may be able to make the clothes more 
cheaply, but the strategic asset retained by Zara is the ability to quickly deliver 
new fashions to its stores. Information flows (see Figure 14.1) from the store 
floors back to the designers, who redesign the products to fit the customers’ 
changing ideas and tastes. In fashion, nothing is as important as time to market 
[Helft, 2002]. Zara has new designs arriving in its stores every two weeks. Many 
new designs arrive at the stores within a few days.
Logistics is the organization of moving, storing, and tracking parts, materi-
als, and equipment. Logistics can be the basis of competitive advantage since a 
firm with fast, accurate logistics will be first to respond to customers. Logistics 
systems usually are based on electronic networks, such as a supply chain intranet. 
Companies look for unique ways to service customers quickly through improved 
tracking, transporting, handling, and delivery in an effort to create unique com-
petencies. Apple is a good example of a company that uses logistics as a com-
petitive advantage. Although Apple does some final assembly, it works through 
suppliers and partners to build almost all of its products. Apple benefits from not 
having to carry its own inventory and it can gain significant discounts from its 
suppliers as a result of the volume commitments that Apple can make. In addi-
tion, Apple uses its volume to gain significant reductions in transportation costs 
from air and land carriers. Apple is becoming so big, in fact, that the company 
can even get custom parts for noncustom prices because its suppliers experience 
economies of scale even though they are producing for only one company.
Logistics might sound like a simple business of moving things around, but 
it is growing more complex as customers demand timely, customized services. 
New technology and greater use of the Internet opened up new ways of shar-
ing information. Companies are also trying to build only after receiving orders 
from customers (known as built-to-order, or BTO), rather than estimating what 
will be in demand and supplying it from accumulated stocks. The BTO concept

CHAPTER 14   Management of Operations310
tries to avoid producing any item without a firm purchase order. One of the best 
examples of value chain management is Modcloth. Modcloth enables customers 
to specify their desired product and to pay for it before Modcloth starts working 
with outsourced manufacturers to assemble the clothing.
The information flow along the value chain can be facilitated by the Internet 
[Hammer, 2001]. Using this information and working closely with partners along 
the chain to design and manage the activities, efficiencies can be improved. Who 
captures the profits from these efficiencies? Often companies such as Wal-Mart 
and Home Depot have assumed the distribution, sales, and service functions, and 
captured significant value created by their suppliers. Furthermore, by using the 
Internet, companies like Amazon and eBay have become electronic sales and 
distribution channels. At the same time, companies like Nokia are producing 
a seamless manufacturing, distribution, sales, and service offering. Managing 
the value chain is a challenging task for all new business ventures, which can ill 
afford to assume many of the value chain activities.
Wal-Mart has a profit margin less than 4 percent, and many supermarket 
chains have a profit margin less than 2 percent. Clearly, every penny saved is 
a penny earned. The bar code became a mainstream success after Wal-Mart 
adopted it in 1980. Now Wal-Mart will require that its suppliers use radio- 
frequency-identification (RFID) on their supply pallets. RFID relies on a com-
puter chip to hold and convey information. Wal-Mart manages its supply chain 
as if it were an orchestra.
Intermediaries in a value chain make sense only for exchanges in which the 
parties to the transaction can save more money by hiring the intermediary than 
it costs. It can cost 20 percent of revenues to “hire” a retailer to sell a product. Is 
it cheaper to sell direct? Can the Internet reach the same customers effectively?
Value chain speed is important to any new venture. With a long lead time 
from design to the customer, a new firm may wind up with inventory it cannot 
sell. Since many products have short life cycles, the chain must be able to move 
fast. Zara can design and manufacture a new clothing fashion in one week, if 
necessary. On the other hand, a movie studio can take a year to produce a new 
film and introduce it into the market. One of the best examples of value chain 
management is the Dell Computer system, which enables customers to specify 
their desired product and pay for it before Dell starts assembling the computer.
E-Ink Holding Systems: A Tablet and E-Reader Value Chain Participant
E-Ink Holdings pioneered electronic paper technology that provides up to a 
50-percent better contrast ratio than competing alternatives. E-Ink licenses 
this technology to Sony, Motorola, Amazon, and Barnes & Noble. These 
corporations utilize E-Ink’s technology in their tablets and readers so the 
users of the products have an easier time reading their displays.

14.2   Processes and Operations Management 311
While goods and services flow largely down the chain, information flows in 
both directions. For example, information about what is demanded at successive 
stages passes up the chain, while information about supply conditions such as 
availability, pricing, time-to-manufacture, and so on passes down. Because this 
is an information-intensive process, the Internet holds the potential to signifi-
cantly increase the amount of value created.
A new venture’s lasting core competency is its ability to continuously 
assess industrial and technological dynamics, build value chains that exploit 
current opportunities, and select the high value-added activities for operation by 
the firm itself.
14.2 Processes and Operations Management
An operation is a series of actions, and operations management is the supervis-
ing, monitoring, and coordinating of the activities of a firm carried out along the 
value chain. Operations management deals with processes that produce goods and 
services. A process is any activity or set of activities that takes one or more inputs, 
transforms and adds value to them, and provides one or more outputs [Krajew-
ski and Ritzman, 2002]. Processes are the series of operations, methods, actions, 
tasks, or functions leading to the creation of an end product or  service. Processes 
are used to transfer value to customers in the form of products. A product could 
involve delivering a tangible good to customers, it could involve performing a ser-
vice for customers, or it could be, and usually is, a combination of the two [Melnyk 
and Swink, 2002]. At a factory, a process transforms materials into products. At 
an insurance company, a process transforms client information into an insurance 
agreement. A network of processes helps create the value provided at each stage of 
the value chain. Business processes can add unique value to products and services.
The business processes of an organization should be aligned with its strate-
gies and employee competencies, as shown in Figure 14.2. Alignment requires 
a continual rebalancing of strategy, business processes, and the competencies of 
the people to satisfy and retain the customers in order to keep the business theory 
as the clear driving force of the business, as shown in Figure 14.2. The business 
theory should be expressed as a clear statement of vision and  purpose. Recall the 
vision statement of eBay: “We help people trade practically anything on Earth 
through an online system.”
Ergonomics is making a physical task easier and less stressful to accom-
plish. Products should be designed ergonomically, and tools used in factories 
need to be ergonomic. For example, Herman Miller’s Aeron chair has been 
acclaimed as an ergonomically pleasing product. It provides form-fitting sup-
port and maximum comfort due to a suspension system that allows for proper 
ventilation.
Processes bring value to customers and stakeholders. Business success 
comes, in large part, from a company’s process performance. Therefore, a firm 
should strive for superior process design. An example of a simple business pro-
cess is shown in Figure 14.3. Part of this process can be automated.

Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce founded Intel in 1968. Their first act 
was to recruit a director of operations. They offered the job to Andrew 
S.  Grove, who became Intel’s third employee. Though Grove had no 
manufacturing experience, they recognized his innate intelligence and 
drive. Grove was responsible for getting products designed on schedule 
and built within budget. The scope of this position extended into nearly 
every functional area at Intel, from marketing to sales to engineering. 
His influence, presence, and attitudes pervaded the company, and within 
three years of Intel’s formation, it became clear that the majority of daily 
decision-making was passing to Grove. Operations has always played a 
critical role in Intel’s success.
Intel’s Operations Strategy
Functions in operations management include design of processes, quality 
control, capacity, and operations infrastructure. The new venture needs to plan 
for its operations or production function, which will be led by one member of 
the entrepreneurial team. Both service and product firms need to design and 
control operational processes to achieve efficiencies, throughput, capacity avail-
ability, inventories, capital expenditures, and productivity. Unique operational 
 management competencies can be part of the competitive advantage of a firm 
[Vonderembse and White, 2004].

14.2   Processes and Operations Management 313
The best return on investment is often found in companies that combine 
operational excellence—consistently outstanding performance for customers 
that is brought to the bottom line—with sustained rapid growth. Operational 
excellence is a necessity today. Investors mercilessly punish companies that fail 
to meet these expectations [Lucier and Dyer, 2003]. Operational excellence can 
lead to lower costs, as shown in Figure 14.4. With economies of scale, unit costs 
will drop, and thus, prices can decline. As prices drop, the product is more attrac-
tive and sales increase. As financial resources increase, investments in market-
ing and operational processes will lead to better economies of scale. This can be 
a very powerful self-reinforcing loop.
A firm can implement four competitive capabilities: low cost, high quality, 
speed, and flexibility. Quality is a measure of a product that usually includes 
performance and reliability. Performance is the degree to which a product 
meets or exceeds certain operating characteristics. Reliability is a measure 
of how long a product performs before it fails. On-time speed mea sures the 
pace of lead time, on-time delivery, and product development.  Flexibility is 
a measure of a firm’s ability to react to a customer’s needs quickly. All of 
these goals need to be achieved while operating with the additional goal of 
worker safety.

CHAPTER 14   Management of Operations314
Many firms have adopted a six-sigma quality goal, with the aim of getting 
rid of defects in a process. Six sigma is a statistical term that measures how much 
a process deviates from the ideal. Six-sigma quality equals just 3.4 flaws per 
million. The six-sigma method attempts to build low-defect products with low 
costs [El-Haik and Roy, 2005]. Six-sigma quality is the result of a  well-defined 
and structured process that is highly repeatable—a process with  well-defined 
tasks and milestones.
Consumers often react favorably or unfavorably to the experience they have 
with a product or service, such as the packaging, clarity of an operating manual, 
or ease of use. Many customers view consumption as an experience rather than 
a singular purchase event [LaSalle and Britton, 2003]. Most products or ser-
vices include objective value, such as performance, and subjective value, such 
as experience. A candle purchased for light might cost only $1, while a second 
candle with shape, form, and scent may provide a richer experience (and sell for 
$5 to $10). Thus, for many products, the value of the  product involves the expe-
rience of it and the associated purchase and fulfillment process. The designer 
needs to identify, design, and fulfill a customer experience that will register with 
the customer as positive.
Supply-chain management is focused on the synchronization of a firm’s 
processes and those of its suppliers to match the flow of materials, sources, and 
information that meets customer demand. Today, the goal is to minimize the 
FIGURE 14.4 Self-reinforcing growth 
through acquisition of customers. A self-
reinforcing loop, R, is assumed to work as long 
as the economies of scale are actually realized 
through effective operational processes.

stock of goods or inventory required to support variability of customer demand. 
As products become more susceptible to changing demands, the risk grows that 
a given product line will have disappointing sales. But if a manufacturer decides 
to go lean on inventories, it risks running out of stock, losing sales, and endan-
gering relationships with its customers.
Operations systems that are designed to create efficient processes by using a 
total systems perspective are called lean systems. Flexible or lean systems aim 
to reduce setup times and increase the utilization of key processes. Flexible sys-
tems can quickly respond to changes in demand, supply, or processes with little 
cost or time penalty. They often use a just-in-time (JIT) approach that focuses 
on reducing unnecessary inventory and removing non-value-added activities. 
This system uses a pull method in which the customer activates production. For 
example, an order for an auto chassis at a carmaker activates the manufacturing 
processes [Liker, 2004].
The Taguchi method is used to design and improve production systems. 
The Taguchi method is a technique for designing experiments that converge on 
a near-optimal solution for a robust system. The method uses the term noise 
to describe uncontrolled variations and states that a quality product should be 
robust to noise factors. The design of a firm’s production system is critical to its 
overall success [Ulrich and Eppinger, 2004].
Companies strive for quality service at low cost. Google, the Web search 
firm, handled 7 billion page views a day in 2012 with a hardware plant of about 
one million servers (computers) that cost about $2,000 apiece. When a server 
fails, Google pulls it and replaces it immediately. Google has no fix-it depart-
ment; it just pulls and inserts. With this approach, Google saves funds and keeps 
its system up 99.99 percent of the time [Barroso et al., 2003].
Entrepreneurial firms seek to develop unique capabilities by fostering an 
interactive dynamic between their capabilities and market opportunities. The 
market provides them with signals of opportunities, and they respond with new 
products. Adjustment of business models, production capabilities, and skill for-
mation enable the firm to respond to opportunity. In value networks, firms focus 
on their core competencies and use others for complementary capabilities.
The goal of operations throughput efficiency (TE) may be measured by the 
formula
 TE 5  VA (14.1)   VA 1 NVA
where VA 5 value-adding time and NVA 5 non-value-adding time. Exam-
ples of NVA are waiting in a queue or system downtime. The goal is to reduce 
NVA.
Gentex, which makes rearview mirrors and other auto equipment, uses tech-
nology to control costs and increase throughput (see www.gentex.com). Gen-
tex continually adds automation and monitoring systems in its factories and 
increased its throughput 30 percent from 2001 to 2003 [Green, 2003].

14.3 The Value Web
Intuitive Surgical, Inc., makes surgical robots used in prostate and heart 
bypass surgeries. When they are given the opportunity to test drive the da 
Vinci robot, surgeons quickly become enamored with the level of control 
they achieve, using only a small incision. Although Intuitive Surgical’s 
robots have been enthusiastically embraced, the company continues to find 
ways to make the surgical experience better for doctors and patients. The 
small incisions improve overall efficiency in the healthcare system, since 
they lead to more rapid recovery times for patients. Intuitive is looking at 
ways to provide ultrasound and other diagnostic images on the same screen 
that the surgeon uses to control the robot. This would improve efficiency by 
letting the surgeon focus on only one image, and improve the real-time sur-
gical experience by making sure that all relevant information is only a click 
away (www.intuitivesurgical.com).
Improving Operations in the Operating Room
A series of business activities can be thought of as a business process, as shown 
in Figure 14.5. Another way to describe a process is as a set of interrelated tasks 
accomplished in a network of activities. Instead of a value chain—a linear series 
of processes—the value-creating process can be organized as a value web. 
Webs are grids with no center but allow open communication and movement 
of items and ideas. In a web, each participant focuses on a limited set of core 
 competencies [Tapscott et al., 2000]. A value web is usually based on an Inter-
net infrastructure to manage operations dispersed in many firms. The value web 
consists of the extended enterprise within a network of interrelated stakeholders 
that create, sustain, and enhance its value-creating capacity. The long-term suc-
cess of a firm is determined by its ability to establish and maintain  relationships 
within its entire network of stakeholders. It is relationships rather than transac-
tions that are the ultimate sources of organizational wealth [Post, 2002]. The 
value web of a typical firm is shown in Figure 14.6.
The value web organized and operated by Amazon includes participants 
such as Ingram, Target, and Toys-R-Us. Amazon takes responsibility for choos-
ing and offering the product selections, setting prices, and ensuring fulfillment. 
Cisco Systems leads a value web that provides its routers and computers to its 
customers. Cisco designs and markets the product, while others do most of the 
manufacturing, fulfillment, and on-site customer service. The Cisco Systems 
value web is shown in Figure 14.7. Recall from earlier chapters that CRM means 
customer relationship management. Cisco defines the goals and coordinates the 
integration of the value web providers. Many new ventures will use the Internet 
to coordinate their value web effectively.
Consider the operations management strategy of IKEA, the Swedish fur-
niture company that has 332 stores in 38 countries. Its business strategy is to 
make and sell inexpensive, solid, well-designed furniture through large stores.

14.3   The Value Web 317
Its business process starts with the identification of a needed product and the 
specification of a low target price for this item. Next, IKEA determines what 
materials will be used and what manufacturer will do the assembly work. IKEA 
buys from about 1,800 suppliers in 55 countries. The next step is to design the 
item and select the parts. After manufacture, the item is shipped disassembled 
in a flat cardboard box to one of IKEA’s 18 distribution centers and ultimately 
to one of its stores. IKEA sells its unassembled furniture without salespeople. 
The customer selects the item, gets the correct box from its rack, and brings it 
to the checkout counter. IKEA implements a low-cost, quality strategy through 
a far-flung value network that provides design, parts, and manufacturing in a 
coordinated manner.
In the past as companies grew, they added assets. As companies grow today, 
they tend to add relationships and enhance their value web. Orchestrating a value

web is a powerful process for growth. Of course, it is possible to develop too 
complex a web of partners and lose control. Effective management of the value 
web enterprise requires a new conception of the firm as a network, rather than a 
hierarchy. The key to effective implementation is recognition of value web man-
agement as a core competence.
In a fast-paced, competitive world, competitive advantage can result from 
the effective concurrent design of products, processes, and capabilities. Design-
ing the product, how it is produced, and a supply chain that works harmoni-
ously is critical to a firm’s success. The firm that controls the interdependent 
links in the value web captures the most profit [Lawre nce et al., 2005]. The 
 coordinated  product, process, and supply chain  system is depicted in Figure 14.8 
[Fine et al., 2002].

CHAPTER 14   Management of Operations320
Networks of people communicate, in part, using technological means such as 
the Internet. The use of the Internet is widespread. It is estimated that about 
80 percent of the North American population and two-thirds of the European 
population used the Internet in 2013. Similar growth of the use of Internet is 
occurring worldwide. The Internet is ubiquitous, cheap, and standardized, and 
it accommodates data, voice, video, and e-mail. It readily allows individuals 
to search, collaborate, coordinate, and transact. Thus, a new business venture 
can use the Internet to synchronize its activities through different channels, 
through different stages of the value experience, and across different offerings 
[Sawhney and Zabin, 2001]. Perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of the Inter-
net is that it gives virtually everybody access to the same information. It is this 
transparency that has caused the shift in power from sellers to buyers. More-
over, because transaction costs can be much lower on the Internet than in tradi-
tional channels, companies can shift some or all of their business and supplier 
functions onto the Web.
E-commerce involves digitally enabled commercial transactions between 
and among organizations and individuals. E-commerce grew using Internet tech-
nology starting in 1995. Between 1998 and 2000, venture capitalists invested 
$120 billion in about 12,500 Internet start-ups, often called “dot.coms.” Suc-
cessful dot.coms include Amazon.com, eBay, and Yahoo. Jeff Bezos founded 
Amazon in 1995 as an online bookstore, raising several million dollars for the 
venture. Amazon offers convenience, low prices, and a wide selection of books 
and other items. In May 1997, Amazon raised $50 million by selling its shares 
to the public for the first time. By 2000, it held a clear position as the world’s 
largest online retailer. Another use of the Internet is the distribution of infor-
mation in the form of a magazine or a newsletter. The New York Times and 
The Economist have successfully offered an online version in addition to their 
print editions.
The Internet also facilitates three important functions: personalization, cus-
tomization, and versioning [Luenberger, 2006]. Personalization is the provi-
sion of content specific to a user’s preferences and interests. It uses software 
programs to find patterns in customer choices and to extrapolate from them. 
For example, Amazon provides personalized book and music recommenda-
tions. Customization is providing a product customized to a user’s preferences. 
Navigenics offers health-risk profiles customized to the genetics of its users. 
Versioning is the creation of multiple versions of a product and the sale of 
these modified versions to different market segments at different prices. The 
New York Times offers a free online version of today’s newspaper but charges 
per article for archived material.
While personalization and customization are good ideas, there are some 
concerns. Many users report that they do not notice any differences in the site

due to personalization. Often, attempts to customize are cumbersome and imper-
fect. Customization is a more powerful approach if executed well since the cus-
tomer is actively involved in the selection process. Customization is a powerful 
tool when customers want their preferences converted directly into a specific 
form of product.
A central activity of the Internet is the search process that enables users to 
find information on a seemingly infinite set of items, ideas, terms, and issues. 
A buyer of airline tickets can use Expedia, Travelocity, and Orbitz to search for 
a bargain. Travel services appear to be an ideal service/product for the Internet 
since travel is an information-intensive product requiring significant consumer 
research. 
Not all customers want to do business online; most prefer having a choice 
of various ways. The hybrid model, sometimes called “bricks and clicks” or 
“clicks and mortar,” utilizes the best of the Internet as well as other channels. 
A hybrid model can extend a company’s reach to new market segments as well 
as its global reach. Alliances are set up to combine the functions served by each 
company, such as the partnership between Drugstore.com and Amazon early in 
their corporate histories.
The advantages of e-commerce are low transaction costs, ubiquity, wide 
reach, and massive information. Since product and price information are readily 
available on the Web, the pricing power of many industries has diminished. Fur-
thermore, many early e-commerce ventures underpriced their products in order 
to secure customers but never showed a profit and eventually failed. A firm must 
have a competitive advantage to sustain itself, and very low prices may not per-
mit profitability. Because of the wide reach of the Internet, many competitors 
can imitate successful offerings, thus eroding the competitive advantage of any 
one firm.
Internet ventures have the potential to offer extensive selection of their 
wares. For niche markets, Internet providers can offer an advantage over 
physical stores. Amazon and the iTunes Music Store exploit this advantage 
[ Economist, 2012]. Apple’s iTunes has become the largest music retailer in the 
world.
Jeff Bezos realized that Amazon had a unique competency that could pro-
vide value to other, especially brick-and-mortar, companies. Amazon had a huge 
online infrastructure and significant experience with direct-to-customer shipping. 
With these advantages in Internet retailing, it began to offer its services to other 
companies. A full spectrum of retail services were rolled out for individuals, 
small and medium businesses, and even large corporations. Amazon  Commerce 
is Amazon’s partnership program with major traditional retailers such as Target 
and Sears. Through this program, Amazon creates a branded website, handles 
online sales, and provides customer support and order fulfillment. This arrange-
ment yields additional revenue for Amazon and gives traditional retailers access 
to a critical distribution channel—the Internet.

CHAPTER 14   Management of Operations322
General Electric Vice Chairman Gary Rogers created the idea for a digi-
tal dashboard—the continuously updated online display of a company’s 
vital statistics [Tedeschi, 2003]. GE’s “digital cockpits” now give hundreds 
of managers instant access to the company’s essential data on computers, 
 tablets, and smartphones [Tedeschi, 2003].
General Electric’s Digital Cockpits
New firms also should develop diagrams and flowcharts that show how their 
operations work. An operational plan outlines a number of actions that will be 
taken in the future. To consolidate the timing of events, the firm should pre-
pare a schedule, in chart form, of all of the important milestones that the firm 
Strategic control is the process used by firms to monitor their activities, 
evalu ate the efficiency and performance of these activities, and take corrective 
action to improve performance, if necessary. The goal is to keep the firm’s 
operations on track with the performance goals of efficiency, quality, and 
responsiveness to customers.
To evaluate the effectiveness of their strategies, some companies develop a 
balanced scorecard, a set of measurements unique to a company that includes 
both financial and operational metrics. This gives managers a quick yet com-
prehensive picture of the company’s total performance. The balanced scorecard 
is a strategy formulation device as well as a report of performance. A suc-
cessful balanced scorecard measures the tangible objectives that are consistent 
with meeting an organization’s goals. The business operations area indicates 
how the operations and processes should work to add value to customers. The 
customer area indicates how the company’s customer-oriented strategy  and 
operations add financial value. The financial area measures the company’s 
 success in adding value to shareholders. The learning and growth area indi-
cates how the  infrastructure for innovation and long-term growth should con-
tribute to strategic goals. A balanced scorecard appears in  Figure 14.9 [Kaplan 
and  Norton, 2004].
To build an effective scorecard, a firm needs to determine the fundamental 
drivers of performance and measure them. Finding the right measures such as 
reliability, quality, or customer satisfaction is challenging, but can yield big pay-
offs. Jack Welch of General Electric promoted the company’s slogan “Finding 
a Better Way Every Day,” which addressed improvement of business processes. 
Then, he added the idea of measuring the performance of the processes. As a 
result, operating margins went from 1.2 percent in 1994 to 13.8 percent in 2000 
[Welch, 2002]. Welch believed that the system of operations was the key to 
understanding, learning, and improving results.

expects to reach in the near and intermediate term. A Gantt chart is a way to 
depict the sequence of tasks and the time required for each. Gantt charts, by 
using shaded bars on a grid, compare what was done with what was planned over 
time. Timelines are a visual means of comparing the actual and planned progress 
of a project or activity. Timelines allow participants to envision the ending of an 
otherwise open-ended plan [Yakura, 2002].
Enterprises of any size can profit from using Gantt charts to depict sched-
ules and milestones. For example, completion of task B could represent the com-
pletion of a prototype, and task C could represent the testing of the prototype 
(see Figure 14.10). It is important to set milestones and then strive to reach them 
on time.
Another, perhaps more graphic, form of representing the activities, out-
comes, and schedule is to use a milestone picture, as shown in Figure 14.11. This 
depicts a road map to achieve a scheduled outcome.

14.6 Spotlight on Clean Harbors
Clean Harbors, Inc. is a provider of environmental, energy, and industrial services, 
including hazardous waste disposal. Its clients include Fortune 500 companies 
and federal, state, provincial, and local governments. Current CEO Alan McKim 
founded the company in Brockton, Massachusetts, in 1980. Clean  Harbors has 
since expanded to more than 470 locations throughout North America.
Effective management of operations has been a key to Clean Harbor’s growth. 
For example, the company was a pioneer in the use of GPS tracking for fleet 
vehicles, which enabled it to reduce vehicle loss and to allocate resources more 
effectively. The company also has undertaken a variety of acquisitions in order 
to expand its resources and capabilities. For example, in the 1990s and 2000s, it 
acquired a number of incinerator and treatment companies; in 2009, it acquired 
Eveready, Inc. which provided services for the oil and gas industry; and in 2012 it 
acquired Safety-Kleen, which had expertise in oil recycling and re-refining.
Through these acquisitions, Clean Harbor has become increasingly vertically 
integrated. Since Clean Harbor is a service organization that works with physical 
products, it operates a large number of locations. These many locations enable 
Clean Harbor to have resources close to most any point of need. They also allow 
the company to engage with a wide range of customers and partners. In turn, these 
relationships enable Clean Harbor to acquire new technology and knowledge.
14.7 Summary
A new venture needs to design a set of operational processes that will enable it 
to build, store, and ship the products provided to the customer. New businesses 
build a supply chain of partners that add value at each stage of the assembly 
or manufacture of the product. Service companies use business processes to put 
together their service outputs. The new venture manages its value chain to effec-
tively provide the final product or service to its customer. The firm also needs to 
effectively manage the logistics of parts and materials. It strives to achieve the 
best possible coordination of its partners as well as its internal processes.
Many firms establish a set of interrelated activities as a network facilitated 
by an Internet-based value web. With a common schedule, associated tasks, and 
synchronization, the venture can manage the value web to maintain an  efficient, 
on-time business process.
Principle 14
The design and management of an efficient, real-time set of production, 
logistical, and business processes can become a sustainable competitive 
advantage for a new enterprise.

 CHAPTER 15
Acquisitions and Global Expansion
Opportunity is rare, and a wise person will never let it go by.
Bayard Taylor
How can entrepreneurs best manage expansion 
via acquisitions and entry into new geographic 
markets?
E
ntrepreneurs often create a new business 
by acquiring an existing firm and then 
improving it. The acquirers attempt to cre-
ate growth and new value for the firm. Another 
strategy is for entrepreneurs to start and build their 
own firm and then expand the company by acquir-
ing other firms. A series of successful acquisitions 
can help build a firm into a powerful leader in an 
industry. The integration of the newly acquired 
firm within the existing firm is a large challenge, 
however, especially when the cultures of the two 
firms differ significantly.
Most new firms develop, at the appropriate 
time, a plan for building an international strategy 
for growth. The forces for globalization are pow-
erful, and new business ventures need to plan for 
them.

15.1  Acquisitions and the Quest for Synergy
eBay and PayPal announced their combination in July 2002, promising mul-
tiple synergies. The press release added:
In a move that will help millions of Internet users buy and sell online, 
eBay, Inc., the world’s online marketplace, today announced that it has
eBay and PayPal
An acquisition is when one firm purchases another. Usually the acquired com-
pany gives up its independence, and the surviving firm assumes all assets and 
liabilities. Acquisitions are one form of corporate entrepreneurship that can be 
particularly useful as an established company tries to innovate and infuse the 
organization with more entrepreneurial behavior or new product lines. Buying an 
existing business also can reduce the risk of entering a new product or market 
area because the business’s operating history provides valuable data. Moreover, 
purchasing an established business has the advantages of ongoing  businesses: cus-
tomers, employees, products, equipment, and location(s). Obvious potential dis-
advantages, however, include poor location, depleted assets, obsolete inventory, 
depreciated brand, disenchanted customers or employees, and lack of profitability.
The three main steps for acquiring a company are (1) target identification and 
screening, (2) bidding strategy, and (3) integration or transition to the acquirer. 
Finding and evaluating an acquisition candidate can be time-consuming. Most, 
if not all, acquisitions are justified on the basis of an expected synergy, which 
is the increased effectiveness and achievement produced as a result of the com-
bined action of the united firms. Suppose that you identify a firm that you deter-
mine is worth V and that a bid for its acquisition is accepted at a price of V. Then 
you estimate that after adding the value created by you and the entrepreneurial 
team, the value of the newly revitalized firm will be V
N. We then expect a syn-
ergy (Syn) as defined as:
Syn 5 VN 2 V
The synergy is the expected value added by the acquiring party. The source of 
the synergy may be revenue enhancements and cost reductions due to capabili-
ties and resources introduced into the firm by the new entrepreneur team. When 
new entrepreneurs acquire an existing business, the synergy is the added value 
of the entrepreneurial team that often replaces the management team of the 
acquired firm. The new team strives to add value to the acquired team’s prod-
uct that will be rarely available to competitors and is difficult to imitate. Thus, 
acquirers try to find firms with valuable and scarce product innovations that can 
be enhanced by the capabilities of the acquirer’s management team.
After finding a good acquisition, the acquirer needs to arrange financing and 
negotiate the terms of the deal. It is a good rule to avoid bidding contests and to 
close the deal in a timely way.

agreed to acquire PayPal, Inc., the global payments platform. A natural 
extension of eBay’s trading platform, the acquisition supports the com-
pany’s mission to create an efficient global online marketplace. Pay-
ment is a vital function in trading on eBay, and integrating PayPal’s 
functionality into the eBay platform will fundamentally strengthen the 
user experience and allow buyers and sellers to trade with greater ease, 
speed, and safety.
Source: eBay Press Release, July 8, 2002.
We will consider three common methods of valuation of a firm used by 
acquirers: (1) book value, (2) price-to-sales ratio, and (3) price-to-earnings ratio. 
The book value is the net worth (equity) of the firm, which is the total assets 
minus intangible assets (patents, goodwill) and liabilities. The price- to-sales 
and  price-to-earnings ratios are obtained for comparative firms in a specific 
 industry.
Consider a firm that designs and makes orthopedic devices for injured and 
disabled people. An accounting consultant determines that the net worth of the 
firm is $800,000. Annual revenues have remained at $1.2 million over the past 
two years. The firm has several patented products, but it has not fully exploited 
its marketing opportunities. Therefore, the net worth or book value sets a base 
value of $800,000 for the firm. With no growth in revenues, the accountant 
suggests a purchase value of one-half of sales, or $600,000. Earnings have held 
steady at $100,000 per year for the past several years. Assuming a compara-
ble price-to-earnings ratio of nine for a zero-growth firm, the valuation could 
be nine times earnings, or $900,000. Assuming these three valuation meth-
ods ($800,000, $600,000, and $900,000), the buyer chooses a target price—
say, $700,000—and tries to determine a suitable deal structure. One starting 
arrangement could be $200,000 in cash with the remaining $500,000 as a loan 
from the seller of the firm set at the prime rate for four years. Ultimately, the 
valuation and the final deal are a result of negotiation between buyer and seller.
Often acquisitions end up eroding the value of the acquired company due 
to difficulties with the transition to new ownership and overestimation of the 
value of the acquired firm. When a transition to the acquirer is attempted, dif-
ficulties may occur in working with or changing the established culture of the 
acquired firm. These transitions can be especially difficult when the two firms 
have dissimilar product offerings or operate in different geographies [Ellis et 
al., 2011]. Differences in trust between the buyer and seller also can challenge 
an acquisition’s success [Graebner, 2009].
Before entering into an acquisition, a new venture should consider the tech-
nology and customer uncertainty. If the uncertainty is high, it may be appropri-
ate to consider an alliance, which will normally cost less and limit the firm’s 
financial exposure. If the alliance starts showing results, then a move to acqui-
sition may be appropriate [Dyer et al., 2004].

CHAPTER 15   Acquisitions and Global Expansion332
Earl Bakken and Palmer Hermundslie founded Medtronic as a medical 
equipment repair company in Minnesota in 1949. The company sustained itself 
early on by selling and servicing medical equipment and building many of its 
own custom devices as well. In 1957, Medtronic developed the first wearable 
external  cardiac pacemaker. Three years later, Medtronic purchased the exclu-
sive rights to the first implantable pacemaker. The company grew to be a leading 
manufacturer of heart pacing technology worldwide. Sales outside the United 
States were strong, but competition was fierce. In response, Medtronic began 
establishing international facilities, and it gained direct control of its interna-
tional operations in 1968 by purchasing the firm that had been its sales agent in 
Canada. Medtronic then began to acquire the firms that had been its major dis-
tributors in the United States, thus building a direct sales force to market prod-
ucts around the world.
In the 1980s, Medtronic purchased Johnson & Johnson’s Cardiovascular 
Division. In addition, Medtronic acquired nearly a dozen other medical  technology 
companies, enabling it to enter new markets. Acquisitions included a manufac-
turer of coronary angioplasty catheters and guiding catheters, a producer of cen-
trifugal blood pumps, and a Dutch pacemaker manufacturer. By 1990, through a 
combination of internal developments and strategic acquisitions, Medtronic had 
successfully made the transition from a company with a limited product line to 
an international, diversified, medical technology corporation. By continuing to 
acquire market leaders with strategic mergers in the 1990s and 2000s, Medtronic 
has maintained its leadership with the medical technology industry.
15.2  Acquisitions as a Growth Strategy
Acquisitions and mergers can serve as a growth strategy in fragmented indus-
tries. A merger refers to the fusing together of two companies. An acquisition 
is when one company buys another. The difference between a merger and an 
acquisition is the degree of control by one of the two firms; a merger may result 
in 50-50 control. Mergers involve a much higher degree of cooperation and inte-
gration between the partners than do acquisitions. Most of the time, mergers 
occur between relatively equal-sized organizations, while, in acquisitions, one 
organization tends to be larger and more established. Many mergers suffer from 
insufficient integration of the functions and activities of the two firms.
In fragmented industries, numerous small companies are differentiated as 
specialists and compete for market share. Powerful forces are driving industries 
to consolidate into oligopolies. An oligopoly is an industry characterized by just 
a few sellers. The incentives to consolidate are significant in the technology, 
media, and telecommunication industries, where fixed costs are large and the 
cost of serving each additional customer is small.
An oligopoly, a market in which a few sellers offer similar products, is not 
always undesirable. It can produce efficiencies that allow firms to offer consum-
ers better products at lower prices and lead to industrywide standards that create 
stability for consumers. But an oligopoly can allow some businesses to make big

15.2   Acquisitions as a Growth Strategy 333
profits at the expense of consumers and economic progress. It can destroy the vital 
competition that prevents firms from pushing prices well above costs. Many indus-
tries also face large fixed costs. A typical semiconductor  fabrication plant now costs 
between $2 billion and $3 billion, compared with $1 billion five years ago. A maker 
of basic memory chips must sell far more integrated circuits (chips) to justify an 
investment of that size. This is why  makers of memory chips are eager to merge.
Industries tend to become more efficient as they undergo consolidation 
[Sheth and Sisodia, 2002]. In a fragmented market, the consolidator firm within 
the industry can realize the synergy of the economics of scale. A new venture 
in a mature industry ripe for consolidation can offer good opportunity. The new 
entrant can concentrate the resources and use them effectively in one niche and 
then acquire small competitor firms as resources to do so become available 
[ Santos and Eisenhardt, 2009]. An example of a fragmented industry is the Inter-
net service provider (ISP) sector. Every town has many independent ISPs as well 
as large competitors, such as Comcast and CenturyLink. As these large firms 
consolidate their strength, the small  competitors are fading.
A merger can stimulate growth if the new conjoined firm has a sound busi-
ness plan for the near-term future that includes a few key measures of profitabil-
ity. The merged firms should work to redeploy unproductive assets and focus on 
optimizing their joint activities.
Most studies show that about two-thirds of mergers do not pay off with 
any synergy or gains. To realize the full value of a merger, the merged orga-
nizations must be appropriately integrated. A horizontal merger is a merger 
between firms that make and sell similar products in a similar market. The 
merger between Exxon and Mobil is an example of a horizontal merger. A verti-
cal merger is the merger of two firms at different places on the value chain.
In 1976, Jim McCann got an urge to own his own business. He bought a 
flower shop in Manhattan for $10,000 and brought in a day-to-day manager. 
He then opened 12 new stores over the next decade. He was doing well and 
left his regular job to build up his floral business. He purchased the troubled 
1-800-Flowers in 1987 for $2 million and assumed $7 million in debt. He then 
moved the firm to New York and merged it with his flower store chain. McCann 
then made a good set of acquisitions, enabling the expansion of 1-800-Flowers. 
It moved beyond flowers to include gifts in the 1990s. Flowers in 1999 acquired 
Great Foods, a specialty food unit. In 2001, Flowers acquired Children’s Group, 
a maker of toys and dolls. Flowers has expanded its candy business by offer-
ing more gift-box products, higher-price candy brands, and express delivery of 
items. Nonfloral items such as baked goods, sweets, and jewelry are offered on 
its website (www.800Flowers.com).
Five different types of mergers and acquisitions appear in Table 15.1 
[Bower, 2001]. The first type aims to reduce overcapacity in a relatively mature 
industry. The acquirer tries to close inefficient plants and reduce costs while 
retaining the acquired firm’s technologies and customers so that economies of 
scale can be realized. The Hewlett-Packard and Compaq merger in 2002 was an 
example of this type.

Many deals are based on acquiring the customers of the acquired company 
and reducing overcapacity. The goal is to identify the best customers and retain 
them while trying to attract new customers from the acquired firm’s customer 
list [Selden and Colvin, 2003].
A geographic extension or roll-up occurs when a successful company rolls 
up (buys up) local or regional firms into a nationwide powerhouse. Roll-ups are 
designed to achieve geographic reach and economies of scale and scope.
The third category, market extension, is designed to extend a company’s 
product line or its entry into unserved markets. To extend its product line, eBay 
purchased PayPal to facilitate transactions with its customers.
A technology acquisition aims to quickly acquire new technologies and 
capabilities by purchasing a small firm. As discussed in Section 13.6, Cisco 
Systems built its performance during the 1990s on a long string of acquisitions 
of small firms. The final type of merger is based on a perception of a future 
convergence of industries. Disney purchased ABC-TV and Radio, envisioning 
a convergence of content and media channels. Often firms use an acquisition to 
restore a sense of vitality to their businesses and, they hope, unleash a subse-
quent surge in performance [Vermeulen, 2005].

15.2   Acquisitions as a Growth Strategy 335
The successful integration of two firms is an important goal of any merger 
or acquisition. For example, Boston Scientific Corporation of Massachusetts 
was a well-respected pioneer in the less-invasive medical device industry 
after its IPO in 1992. Its aggressive acquisition strategy soon led to a merger 
with Scimed Life Systems of Minneapolis, which specialized in angioplasty 
products for catheter-based treatment of cardiovascular disease. Scimed also 
had built a top-notch distribution system in Europe and Japan. After several 
challenging years working to fully integrate the two firms, Boston Scien-
tific became an industry leader, because of the Scimed products, distribution 
 system, and team.
Boston Scientific and Scimed: A Successful Integration
The Hewlett-Packard and Compaq merger was actually based on both over-
capacity reduction and technology acquisition. In this case, the surviving firm, 
Hewlett-Packard, acquired Compaq’s technologies. The goal of the merger was to 
improve HP’s competitiveness since the firm had largely missed out on the per-
sonal  computer and Internet transitions [Anders, 2003].
Rules for integrating an acquired firm into the acquiring firm are provided 
in Table 15.2. The key step is to appoint an integration manager who works 
full-time for a period on integrating the two firms. The integration effort starts 
with a strategy and an integration plan. Then the goal should be to achieve a 
majority of the integration by a short period after the close of the deal—about 
six weeks. An important step is to build an integration team working with the 
integration manager. The team helps build the social connections for the merger 
and get early results. The role of the integration manager is to inject speed into 
the process, create a new structure, make social connections, and build success, 
as summarized in Table 15.3 [Aiello and Watkins, 2000]. The number of overall 
mergers and acquisitions varies depending on market conditions. 
The leaders of entrepreneurial firms often continue to play a vital role after 
an acquisition by a larger firm closes. The leaders of the buying firm are often 
too busy with their own business to provide effective direction to the acquired 
employees. Moreover, they initially may not understand the acquired business 
well enough to make good decisions. This creates a need for the acquired man-
agers to continue to lead their companies, even after the deal closes. Acquired 
leaders can add value by focusing their employees on specific goals and time-
lines, and by helping to resolve problems that arise as employees are assigned to 
their new positions and supervisors [Graebner, 2004].
Acquisitions and mergers are as likely to destroy value as to create it. They 
only add value if they make strategic sense, if their fair value is paid based on 
realistic expectations, and if management stays focused on executing the plan. 
For example, AOL and Time Warner failed to properly mesh the organizations 
and destroyed value [Klein and Einstein, 2003].

15.3 Global Business
A common motivation for mergers and acquisitions is to enter new markets. 
This strategy is often adopted by firms seeking to start doing business in a new 
country. The current globalization phenomenon dates from the fall of the Berlin 
Wall in 1989, which ended the principle division that ruled the world since 1945, 
when the Iron Curtain descended. If the metaphor for the Cold War period was 
the Berlin Wall, the metaphor for globalization is the Web. Globalization is the 
triumph of free-market capitalism worldwide. The previous era of globalization

was built around falling transportation costs. Today’s era of globalization is 
built around falling telecommunications costs [Friedman, 1999]. Globalization 
involves the integration of markets, nation-states, and technologies, enabling 
people and companies to reach around the world to offer and sell their products 
in any country in the world. With the Internet and globalization, a company can 
sell anytime, anywhere. Globalization is characterized by speed, modernization, 
movement, and the removal of distance.
A new venture should consider a globalization strategy, even if it is only to 
decide that its initial strategy is to remain local. A new design-automation firm 
may choose to only serve the United States in its initial years but later  consider 
expanding internationally. We use a classification system for the strategies for 
globalization, as shown in Figure 15.1.
A local or regional strategy focuses all a firm’s efforts locally since that 
is its pathway to a competitive advantage. Early-stage companies often select 
a regional market that they know well and attempt to be successful there first. 
This enables them to understand their customers and why they buy the product 
[Bhidé, 2008]. Thus, a new technology firm may start locally and fashion its 
marketing and sales methods. Then it can go global.
Another reason to remain local initially is limited availability of resources. 
Restaurants, retail stores, and other local opportunities are best started locally. 
For example, Starbucks started in Seattle and moved to other regions of the 
United States only after perfecting its operational capabilities locally.

CHAPTER 15   Acquisitions and Global Expansion338
Riverbed Technologies (a U.S.-based company) is a leading maker of wide 
area network (WAN) optimization devices. The WAN optimization device 
market grew quickly to become a multibillion dollar market in less than a 
decade from the time that devices were first commercialized. Most large 
customers were unwilling to deploy networks that used different WAN opti-
mization devices across different countries. So, Riverbed was forced very 
early in its life to figure out an international strategy. Riverbed partnered 
early on in its existence with distributors and resellers across many coun-
tries, enabling the venture to grow rapidly. Today Riverbed has offices in 
over 30 countries.
Riverbed Technologies and International Strategy
The multidomestic strategy calls for a presence in more than one nation 
as resources permit. In this case, the firm offers a separate product and mar-
keting strategy suitable for each nation. This strategy is not cost-efficient 
but does enable a firm to have independent subsidiaries in many nations. 
Examples of companies using a multidomestic strategy are Nokia and 
Sony-Ericsson.
To exploit cost economies while creating differentiated products, a 
transna tional strategy can be used. This strategy rests on a flow of prod-
uct offerings created in any one of the countries of operation and transferred 
between countries. Examples of companies using a transnational strategy are 
ABB and Caterpillar.
An international strategy tries to create value by transferring products and 
capabilities from the home market to other nations using export or licensing 
arrangements. One benefit of international activities can be the exposure to new 
business environments where the firm can learn about different methods, prod-
ucts, and innovations. Examples are Microsoft and IBM. Microsoft has regularly 
tried to bring the same business model to other countries.
A global strategy emphasizes worldwide creation of new products, sales, 
and marketing. The company uses facilities and organizations in several nations 
to create products for worldwide sales. Examples are General Motors, Intel, and 
Hewlett-Packard. Headquartered in Silicon Valley, Intel’s international business 
has grown to represent 70 percent of its total revenues. Craig Barrett, Intel’s for-
mer CEO, anticipates the largest growth areas in the coming years will be India, 
China, and Russia. These markets represent almost half the world’s population 
and have just recently become available to U.S. technology companies [Barrett, 
2003]. The advantages and disadvantages of each of the globalization strategies 
are listed in Table 15.4 [Hill and Jones, 2001].

15.3   Global Business 339
Founded in India by Tusli Tanzi in 1995, Suzlon Energy is now a leading wind 
turbine manufacturer with an increasingly global strategy. The company has 
operations on five continents with sales, R&D, and manufacturing employ-
ees in locations like India, China, Germany, and Belgium. It offers complete 
wind power solutions including consulting, manufacturing, installation, and 
maintenance to its customers. It has rapidly grown into one of the largest mul-
tinational clean energy companies with sales exceeding $4 billion in 2012. Its 
leadership challenge is now formidable because the firm’s many employees 
are separated by oceans, languages, and cultures (www.suzlon.com).

In general, a new or emerging firm should choose one of the strategies for 
entering the global marketplace and then determine which foreign markets to 
enter and when. The determinants of entry, timing, and costs will lead to the 
selection of a sound strategy. Some industries are local in nature, and others 
are international or global. A new manufacturer of integrated circuits is imme-
diately required to quickly build an international strategy since the competitive 
marketplace is global. For many firms, expansion from local to regional and 
then to national markets will follow a natural progression. The first step is to 
expand to selected nations, establishing appropriate distribution channels and 
supply chains.
International opportunities exist in many industries. Microsoft and Intel sell 
their products worldwide. London’s hit plays, such as Phantom of the Opera, 
move to New York and eventually on worldwide tours. Global opportunities to 
reduce costs, improve capabilities, and match local needs call for a transnational

or global strategy. The resources necessary to mount these strategies can be

Cisco Systems uses an international strategy that enables it to derive about 
50 percent of its revenues from foreign sales in 150 countries. Many new ven-
tures or emerging firms need to consider the development of a global strategy 
to access unique capabilities or advantages. Reasons for considering entering 
the global marketplace are listed in Table 15.5. In turn, the speed at which a 
new venture enters the global marketplace is dependent on competitors’ actions, 
enabling technologies, and the venture’s knowledge and perceptions of foreign 
markets [Oviatt and McDougall, 2005].
It is conventional for a start-up to fully develop and test its product in a local 
or national marketplace before taking it global. Since emerging firms have lim-
ited ability to acquire information and knowledge about foreign markets and to 
manage foreign activities [Julien and Pamangalahy, 2003], they often limit their 
international efforts. Over time, as firms identify international opportunities in the 
same region and around the world, they must balance the pursuit of these oppor-
tunities against their available resources [Kuemmerle, 2005]. Successful entre-
preneurs generalize lessons learned in one context into simple rules that apply to 
the next context [Bingham, 2005]. They also have the ability to improvise their 
execution according to the needs of different contexts [ Bingham, 2009].
A successful global start-up usually has an international vision from incep-
tion, a strong worldwide network, and a unique product in demand worldwide. 
Consumers throughout the world increasingly demand the same selection of 
consumer goods, particularly automobiles, clothing, many food and beverage 
products, and consumer durables such as appliances and electronics. For many 
businesses, this global consumerism has focused sharp attention on the develop-
ment of global brands, which are rapidly creating brand equity positions for their 
companies. Apple, Toyota, and Pfizer are global brands. New ventures need to 
plan for globalization in various ways. As their industry becomes global, they 
must plan for production, regulatory, and organizational factors [Farrell, 2004].
It can be wise to talk and act like a global company from the start, putting 
strategies in place early to protect your intellectual property, and being commit-
ted at a deep level to the success of the international operations. John O’Farrell, 
a partner at the leading venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, recommends 
that a start-up develop a separate global strategy that addresses five key areas for 
global operations: What is your goal in the region? What countries will you focus

on and in what order? What products will you sell? How will you go to market? 
And what is the operating model for the different regions of the world? Going 
global can provide big returns, but only if done with good thought in advance and 
strong tactical operations once deployed [O’Farrell, 2011]. 
The mode of entry into another national or regional market offers five possi-
bilities, as listed in Table 15.6. Exporting is an easy method to start up elsewhere. 
However, high transportation costs can be a disadvantage. Licensing to another 
party for a fee can be an inexpensive method and can provide some control of the 
marketing and manufacturing carried out by the licensee. Franchising is a form 
of licensing with an agreement to follow rules and procedures of operation. This 
method may result in loss of control over the quality of the product.
A joint venture with a foreign company affords access to the partner’s capa-
bilities [Yu et al., 2011]. But, it also results in diminishing control. Thus, care 
must be taken to align the goals of both partners and to address the imbalance in 
bargaining power if one partner is much larger than the other [Lu and Beamish, 
2006]. A wholly owned subsidiary enables the parent company to exercise full 
control but it can be a costly approach.
McDonald’s and Hilton Hotels are usually set up as franchises in other 
nations. Intel and Hewlett-Packard act through wholly owned subsidiaries. Fuji-
Xerox is a joint venture between Xerox-USA and Fuji Photo Film of Japan. 
Harley-Davidson exports about 29 percent of its motorcycles directly to dealers 
and distributors in other countries. 
Honeywell is a U.S.-based Fortune 100 company with large international 
operations. The company is involved in aerospace, environmental controls, 
advanced materials, transportation systems, and technologies for manufacturing 
and process industries. A high percentage of Honeywell’s 132,000 employees 
lives outside the United States, and 55 percent of the company’s revenues comes 
from outside the United States.

FIGURE 15.2 Forces and consequences of globalization.
Globalization is spreading as markets open and deregulate. As shown in 
Figure 15.2, the forces of globalization are powerful [Barkema et al., 2002]. 
Many new firms will need to consider the global factors in their industry and 
create a plan for responding. To be successful, global entrepreneurs need to 
articulate a global purpose, build alliances, create and manage supply chains, 
and learn how to build a trusting organization across different cultures and insti-
tutional frameworks [Isenberg, 2008].
As new firms grow, they need to develop global relationships and work 
with people from other cultures. Cultural intelligence is the capacity of a person 
to adapt to new cultural settings and to interact effectively with people from 
different cultures [Early, 2004]. The three components of cultural intelligence 
are cognitive, physical, and emotional intelligences. Global business depends 
on good cultural relationships and smart cultural intelligence. Successful 
members of global teams learn to cope with different national, corporate, and 
vocational cultures.
Yves Doz of INSEAD defines a metanational company as possessing 
three core capabilities: (1) being the first to identify and capture new knowl-
edge emerging all over the world; (2) mobilizing this globally scattered knowl-
edge to out-innovate competitors; and (3) turning this innovation into value 
by producing, marketing, and delivering efficiently on a global scale [Fisher, 
2002]. Doz identifies one example of such a firm as Nestlé. Other examples 
are IBM and Hewlett-Packard. Perhaps the most challenging task is to access 
knowledge and innovations everywhere and then integrate them into the firm’s 
competencies and products.
Competition is similar to a three-dimensional game of global chess. The 
moves that an organization makes in one market may achieve goals in another 
market in ways that are not immediately apparent to its rivals. Where this strate-
gic interdependence between markets exists, the complexity of the competitive 
situation can quickly overwhelm ordinary analysis. A firm needs an analytic 
process for mapping the competitive landscape and anticipating how its moves 
in one market can influence its interactions in others.

15.5   Summary 343
Leading firms in technology-intensive industries are based on core capabili-
ties that can be leveraged globally. Innovative companies strive to draw knowl-
edge and coordinate capabilities worldwide. They build and discover new assets 
and capabilities, and work to achieve economies of scale and scope. As the firms 
grow, they move toward a global network of capabilities and assets [Tallman 
and Fladmol-Lindguist, 2002].
A truly global firm, such as IBM, HP, Cisco, or Intel, operates as a single 
integrated organization. The firm will move people and projects anywhere in 
the world based upon the right set of costs, skills, and the business environment. 
These firms operate as a “global network enterprise”—a flexible assembly of 
firms that together strives to provide the best set of business processes. These 
networks are no longer transactional (contract-based), but rather rely on mutual 
cooperation and trust [Branscomb, 2008]. They rely on a cooperative network of 
innovation partners.
15.4 Spotlight on Alibaba
Founded in 1999 by Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma, Alibaba was originally 
created as a portal to connect Chinese manufacturers and foreign buyers. The 
company has since evolved into the “Amazon of the East,” with its suite of ser-
vices valued at greater than $50 billion, totaling $160 billion in sales (GMV) 
in 2012.
Alibaba has expanded beyond China to become a global power, with portals 
in seven languages and customers across the world. This growth has been fueled 
in part by partnerships with, investments in, and acquisitions of a number of 
companies operating in the Chinese e-commerce space. Notable among them is 
Alibaba’s 2005 acquisition of Yahoo! China, giving Alibaba a strong footprint 
in news, e-mail and search, as well as close ties to Yahoo!. 
As Alibaba continues to expand its footprint in China to compete with other 
global technology giants, it often does so via strategic investment and acquisi-
tion, preferring to bring on existing, proven technologies rather than spend the 
time to develop them in-house. Examples include strategic investments in Sina 
Weibo, known as “China’s Twitter,” and AutoNavi, a well-known Chinese map-
ping and location-technology company.
15.5 Summary
A new venture may start as a purchase of an existing company by a team of 
entrepreneurs. Alternatively, entrepreneurs can start their new venture and 
acquire other small firms to grow their own company. Most, if not all, acquisi-
tions are justified on the basis of an expected synergy, which is the increased 
effectiveness of the combined firms. Acquisitions can be used for efficiency 
improvement, geographic expansion, product or market extension, and technol-
ogy acquisition.

before taxes and owner’s salary of $100,000. It has annual sales of 
$1 million. As a purchaser of this firm, you select a discount rate of 
14 percent. Calculate the price you would offer for the firm. Assume 
that you can increase and maintain a growth rate of sales and cash flow 
of 2 percent annually.

T
he venture should have a clear revenue model and a workable path to prof-
itability. Furthermore, there should be a plan of how the wealth  created 
will be harvested by the owners. A comprehensive financial plan will be 
designed to demonstrate the potential for growth and profitability that is based 
on accurate and reliable assumptions. With the financial plan in hand, sources 
of investment capital will be explored and tested. The presentation of the total 
business plan will require a compelling story about the venture. Furthermore, 
skillful negotiations about the terms of the deal will be required. When funded 
and launched, the venture team must continuously and ethically implement the 
business plan and adapt to changing conditions.

 16.8 Summary
How will a new venture generate revenue and 
achieve positive cash flow?
A 
new firm creates a sales model describ-
ing how it will generate revenues from 
its customers. Then it determines a cost 
model and how to generate profits from its rev-
enues. The revenue and profit engines show how 
the firm will create powerful value for its custom-
ers and how customers will enable the new firm to 
profit. Many new ventures assume that profit will 
flow naturally from sales but discover that profits 
are not guaranteed. It is difficult to operate in a 
market that is chronically unprofitable.
A new firm seeks positive cash flow as soon 
as is feasible and acts to move to profitability early 
in its life. Managing revenue growth is important 
since uncontrolled growth can lead to negative 
cash flow and the need to constantly raise new 
funds from outside investors. Furthermore, a firm 
needs a plan to harvest the benefits of its growing 
venture for all owners. Entrepreneurs must also 
be realistic and accept that termination of the new 
venture is a possibility.

CHAPTER 16   Profit and Harvest350
16.1 The Revenue Model
A firm’s revenues are its sales after deducting all returns, rebates, and discounts. A 
firm’s revenue model describes how the firm will generate revenue; five models are 
listed in Table 16.1. Most firms generate revenues by selling a product in units to a 
customer using a product sales model. For example, Lenovo sells its personal com-
puters to one customer at a time, and Intel sells its chips to electronics companies.
In the subscription revenue model, a business offers content or a member-
ship to its customers and charges a fee permitting access for a certain period of 
time. This model is used by magazines, information and data sources, and con-
tent websites. Consumer Reports offers its information to magazine subscribers 
(members) as well as to subscribers to its online service for a fee. This model is 
also used by clubs, cooperatives, or other member-based organizations. Technol-
ogy firms sometimes license their technology for a fee.
The advertising revenue model is used by media companies such as mag-
azines, newspapers, and television broadcasters that provide space or time for 
advertisements and collect revenues for each use. The media entities that are able 
to attract viewers or listeners to their ads will be able to collect the highest fees. 
Facebook, Google, and Yahoo collect most of their revenues through the sale of 
advertising space.
Some firms receive a fee for enabling or executing a transaction. The 
 transaction fee revenue model is based on providing a transaction source 
or activity for a fee. Examples of firms based on transaction fees are Charles 
Schwab, Visa, and eBay.
The affiliate revenue model is based on steering business to an affiliate 
firm and receiving a referral fee or percentage of revenues. For example, this 
revenue model is used in the real estate business and by companies that steer 
business to Amazon.
Magazines and newspapers such as the New York Times and The Economist 
use both the subscription and the advertising models to generate revenues. Some 
new ventures use a mix of the five revenue models. Amazon.com, for example, 
uses the product sales, transaction fee, and affiliate revenue models. Google gen-
erates revenues through advertising and licensing its technology to others for a 
subscription fee.
Any new business needs to determine its revenue model and test it on poten-
tial customers. Who is the customer? Will the target customer pay for the offer-
ing? Facebook started out as a social network with no viable revenue- generation 
model. The first model the company tried was display advertising, previously

16.2   The Cost Model 351
JBoss: Generates Revenue Through Service and Support
JBoss of Atlanta, Georgia, has an unusual revenue model and mission: 
“JBoss Inc.’s mission is to revolutionize the way enterprise middleware 
software is built, distributed, and supported through the Professional Open 
Source model. We are committed to delivering innovative and high qual-
ity technology and services that make JBoss the safe choice for enterprises 
and software providers.” Revenue is generated by supporting software that is 
given away for free. By providing professional service and support for open 
source software, JBoss found a comfortable and profitable niche within its 
industry. It was acquired by Red Hat in 2006. (See http://www.jboss.com.)
pioneered by Google. Facebook has generated and continues to generate sig-
nificant revenue from display ads but is currently being challenged to explore 
other models as more of its users are viewing the site from mobile devices on 
which display advertising is less profitable. One new alternative is a search tool 
that mines Facebook’s wealth of user data. The social networking giant believes 
this new search has the potential to challenge Google by delivering far more 
personal, tailored results—recommendations are driven by the likes and interests 
of your Facebook friends rather than an algorithm. As of 2013, the effectiveness 
of this model is still being tested.
Because they have yet to achieve profitability, most start-ups use a revenue 
metric such as revenue per employee to track their performance during their 
formative years. Their goal is to exceed $100,000 per employee as soon as pos-
sible. Most mature growth firms exceed $200,000 per employee, and technology 
companies sometimes exceed $400,000 per employee.
16.2 The Cost Model
A cost driver is any factor that affects total firm costs [Niraj et al., 2001]. 
Typically, costs vary over time or volume of output. The four primary types 
of cost drivers are: fixed, variable, semivariable, and nonrecurring. Fixed costs 
do not vary at all with volume. Examples include rent and management sala-
ries. Variable costs change directly and proportionally with volume. Examples 
include sales commissions (which vary with sales) and materials costs (which 
vary with the amount of goods produced). Semivariable costs also change with 
volume, though not as directly and they contain elements of fixed costs. For 
example, a store may need to keep a minimum staff on hand (which is a fixed 
cost), but can add more staff as the number of customers increases (which is 
a variable cost). Finally, nonrecurring costs occur infrequently or irregularly. 
Examples include equipment and building purchases [Hamermesh et al., 2002]. 
In order to maximize profits, entrepreneurs must be aware of their various cost 
drivers and of the types of costs.

CHAPTER 16   Profit and Harvest352
Profit is the net return after subtracting the costs from the revenues. The profit 
model is the mechanism a firm uses to reap profits from its revenues. Google 
makes most of its profits by auctioning text-based advertisements that appear 
in search results and participating websites. Microsoft makes most of its profits 
from licensing Windows and Office software. General Electric generates one-
third of its profits from its financial arm, GE Capital. Newspapers make most of 
their profits from classified ads. Hewlett-Packard and Xerox make most of their 
profits from replacement toner cartridges.
Figure 16.1 shows the value of a product and the distribution of the value to the 
customers and the profit captured by the firm. To remain profitable, a firm strives 
to reduce its costs while maintaining or increasing the value of its product to the 
customer. To generate profits, a firm needs to examine all its activities on the value 
chain and determine if its cost versus value generated is in line.
Profit accrues to a company that maintains a competitive advantage as con-
ditions change. When the PC industry took off in the 1980s, IBM ceded the 
operating system’s rights to Microsoft when it incorrectly determined that profit 
would flow to the branded integrator of hardware and software components. Key 
to profit capture is ownership of the unique, value-added element of the value 
chain or the product makeup. Examples would be ownership of an essential 
pipeline, control of the customer interface, or ownership of unique locations for 
a retail operation. It pays to hold the largest “value-added” step in a value chain 
or the unique innovation that no one else can match.
During the early years of a firm, the firm may be patient for growth but 
should be impatient for profitability. As a firm works to gain profitability, 
it is testing its assumptions that customers will pay for a profitable product 
[ Christensen and Raynor, 2003].

The revenue and profit engines are driven by the firm’s business model, strat-
egy, resources, capabilities, operations, and processes, as shown in Figure 16.2.
The best conditions for profit occur when the perceived value of a product to 
a customer is high and the cost to produce the product is low. Figure 16.3 shows 
a value grid that enables a firm to determine its potential to reap large profits. 
Low cost to produce a product leads to low price per unit of perceived value to 
the customer. The upper-right quadrant is a high profit location that many firms 
seek to occupy [Chatterjee, 1998].
Most start-ups initially invest time and energy in learning about their cus-
tomers. Then they use that knowledge to create improved solutions for them. 
They lose money initially but make money after a period we will call T, as 
shown in Figure 16.4. Of course, it is best to keep T relatively short and the 
peak negative profit (NP) small [Slywotzky, 2002]. The profit curve shown in 
Figure 16.4 is often called a “hockey stick” expectation.
It is useful to try to estimate the attractiveness (the potential profitability) of 
a market segment. It is of little value to win market leadership in a market seg-
ment that is chronically unprofitable [Ryans et al., 2000].

CHAPTER 16   Profit and Harvest354
A firm can create a metric for its profitability as
metric 5 profit
X
when x is chosen to fit the firm’s goals and business model. As shown in 
Table  16.2, firms chose the variable x so as to illuminate their profitability 
 performance. A commonly used profit metric is profit margin, which is the 
ratio of profit divided by revenues.
Jeff Bezos of Amazon uses a simple two-by-two matrix to describe mar-
gins, as depicted in Figure 16.5. Amazon sits in the lower-left quadrant offering 
products with low margins but selling a high volume of product. In order to sit in 
that quadrant, a company must be incredibly efficient. Amazon has structured its 
entire business around efficiency and has hit the margin goals outlined by Bezos.
During the telecommunications boom of 2000, companies often used poor 
indirect metrics of their growth such as the number of building leases. They

reasoned, wrongly, that access to office buildings would translate to customers 
[Malik, 2003].
A business model designed for high customer relevance that delivers high 
value will have the best chance of capturing profit. The best business model helps 
the customer in the difficult or time-consuming areas of their purchasing process. 
One of the most powerful profit models is the installed base profit model. The 
supplier builds a large installed base of users who then buy the supplier’s consum-
able products. This is the model used by HP, which sells printers at a modest price 
while building a large base of users who purchase consumable ink cartridges. Nine 
types of profit models appear in Table 16.3 [Slywotzky et al., 1999]. A new venture

CHAPTER 16   Profit and Harvest356
will wisely select its needed profit model and work hard to build its strength and 
resiliency in the competitive marketplace.
Managers have always known that some customers are more profitable than 
others. For some emerging firms, 20 percent of the firms’ customers may provide 
most of the firms’ profits. Furthermore, the firms’ worst customers may be costing 
more than they pay for products or services. Securing profitable customers while 
getting rid of unprofitable customers can help to double a firm’s profits. It pays to 
be attentive to the best customers and ignore the worst [Selden and Colvin, 2002].
Recall that profit is
 Profit 5 (P 2 VC)Q 2 FC (16.1)
where P 5 price, VC 5 variable costs, Q 5 total number of units sold, and 
FC  5 fixed costs. Managing profitability can be achieved by lowering fixed 
or variable costs, raising units sold, or raising price. One may be able to find a 
customer segment that is willing to pay a higher price or purchase more units. 
Otherwise, costs need to be lowered.
Another important measure of performance is cash flow, which is the sum 
of retained earnings minus the depreciation provision made by the firm. With-
out positive cash flow, a firm may eventually use up all its cash and close its 
doors. A profit and cash flow model focuses attention on the nature of the driv-
ing forces of the revenue and profit models.
Amazon.com has used aggressive price discounting and free shipping to boost 
its revenues. However, its low operating margin (P 2  VC) made profitability 
 elusive during its formative years.
Many mass-market retailers such as Wal-Mart continually lower prices by 
squeezing inefficiencies from their operations and sacrificing profit margins on 
products in favor of selling in high volumes. Hewlett-Packard tries to avoid low-
ering prices to keep its profit margin robust.
All entrepreneurs need to find a suitable profit model for their firm. If prof-
itability appears to be highly elusive and at best in the distant future, it may be 
wise to not proceed with the venture. We discuss the matter of terminating a 
venture in Section 16.6.
Cemex is a Mexican cement company. In the past, it described its profit 
 metric as yards of concrete sold each day. Cemex realized, however, that its 
customers value the delivery of the right amount of concrete at the right time. 
Using that  metric, profitability increased. The profit model led to the creation 
of a new business model [McGrath, 2005].
16.4 Managing Revenue Growth
New businesses normally strive to build up revenues and profits so that they can 
meet their goals. Most teams are naturally inclined to grow their business rap-
idly, especially in technology entrepreneurship. The degree of commitment of 
the entrepreneurial team to the growth of the firm can be called  entrepreneurial 
intensity [Gundry and Welsch, 2001].

16.4   Managing Revenue Growth 357
Commitment to growth leads to sacrifices an entrepreneur is willing to 
make. High growth can require significant financial resources, leading the entre-
preneurs to seek outside capital and often give up majority ownership of the firm. 
Low growth would include firms growing revenues at a rate less than 10 percent 
per year, and high rates of growth would exceed 25 percent per year. Many 
high-growth firms grow at 50 percent or higher each year for several years after 
founding. Technology entrepreneurs who seek a high-growth strategy will usu-
ally select a team-based organizational structure and exhibit high entrepreneurial 
intensity. Furthermore, they are willing to endure the burdens associated with 
the demands of high growth. The characteristics of a high-growth entrepreneur-
ial team are listed in Table 16.4. High-growth entrepreneurs are willing to put 
aside some of their personal or family goals and make  sacrifices because they 
are committed to the growth of their ventures.
A growing business requires cash for working capital, assets, and oper-
ating expenses. If a company grows too fast, it will need to continually raise 
additional cash from investors. The cash required will depend on the opera-
tions model of the firm, which depends on its accounts payable cycle, as well as 
assets and working capital required [Churchill and Mullins, 2001]. In general, 
most  growing firms are unable to sustain a growth rate of sales exceeding 15 
percent using their internally generated cash. Some service businesses are less 
asset-intense and may be able to self-finance a sales growth rate of 20 percent to 
30 percent. Very few, if any, firms can self-finance if they plan to grow at 
50 percent or more per year. For high growth, a financing plan for outside cash 
will be required.
Since service businesses are often less asset-intensive and more labor- 
intensive than production firms, growth typically adds to costs and may not 
produce economies of scale. Some companies with a heavy emphasis on ser-
vice such as IBM, Starbucks, and Southwest Airlines have managed to suc-
cessfully combine growth and profitability while other companies have not. 
Successful service-oriented companies are able to design and implement the 
right strategies to keep costs low, strengthen customer loyalty, and gain com-
petitive advantage.
The profitability of a firm may be a function of the growth rate of rev-
enues, as shown in Figure 16.6. At a low growth rate such as G
1, the firm is 
unable to meet demand and loses sales to its competitors. At a very high growth 
TABLE 16.4  Characteristics exhibited by entrepreneurial teams that 
seek high growth rates.
 
 ■ Strong entrepreneurial intensity
 ■ Willingness to incur the costs of 
growth
 ■ Willingness to use a wide range of 
financing sources
 ■ Emphasis on a team-based organiza-
tional structure
 ■ Focus on innovation

rate such as G2, the firm is unable to efficiently manage its operations and only 
achieves profitability P 2. Growth rate G m maximizes a firm’s profitability P m. 
An emerging or new firm should try to estimate its growth rate G m that would 
maximize profitability. For many new firms, G m ranges between 20 percent 
and 40 percent.
The profitability of a firm may be represented by its return on capital or 
return on equity (ROE). Thus, one quick estimate of a firm’s ability to grow is to 
state that a firm may grow organically at a rate less than its return on equity with-
out turning to outside financial sources. We define organic growth as growth 
enabled by internally generated funds.
A more complete equation for a sustainable change in sales-to-sales ratio, 
DS/S, for a firm is [Ross et al., 2012]:
 
DS
}S  5 PM(11L)
T 2 [PM(11L)]  (16.2)
where PM 5 profit-to-sales ratio, L 5 debt-to-equity ratio, and T 5 the ratio 
of total assets to sales. If a start-up firm has no debt (L 5 0), we have

For example, if PM 5 0.10 and T 5 0.5, then
DS}S  5 0.10}}0.5 2 0.10  5 0.25
or the sustainable sales growth rate is 25 percent. Consider an asset-intensive 
business with T 5 1.0 and determine the sustainable growth rate when PM  5 
0.10. Then, we have

and the sustainable growth rate is 22 percent.
A start-up will need to examine its expected growth rate and its financing 
needs carefully. As an example, consider the growth of a fictional green-tech 
venture that raised $68 million via an initial public offering in 2008.  Its sales 
were $130 million in 2010 and $518 million in 2013, growing at an annualized 
rate of 44 percent. During the same period, the firm’s long-term debt rose from 
$135 million to $947 million, and its debt-equity ratio rose from 0.16 in 2010 to 
0.96 in 2013. This venture was able to grow sales at a significant rate by increas-
ing its debt (and associated risk)  significantly.
Service firms require less money to start and expand than asset-intensive 
industries. Building and growing a service business requires adding employees. A 
service business has low capital and asset intensity and requires little debt. Con-
sider Infosys, an Indian-based outsourcing company, which grew revenues from 
$4.2 billion in 2007 to $7.0 billion in 2012.  The firm has negligible debt, thus 
L 5 0. The profit-to-sales ratio averaged .44 during 2007 to 2012. The ratio of total 
assets to sales was approximately 1.01. Then, the sustainable growth in sales was
DS
}S  5 PM}T 2 PM  5 .44}}1.01 2.44  5 0.77
or the sustainable growth rate was 77.7 percent.
To grow steadily and avoid stagnation, a company should learn how to scale 
up and extend its business, lengthen its expansion phase, and accumulate and 
apply new knowledge to new products and markets faster than competitors. 
Entrepreneurs should choose a plan that fits with the knowledge, learning skills, 
and assets that the organization possesses or is developing.

CHAPTER 16   Profit and Harvest360
Rapid growth and good profitability can often cover up some underlying 
problems of an organization. They can provide a cushion for wasteful decisions 
regarding the allocation of financial, human, and other resources. The excite-
ment of growth can also veil inadequacies in leadership or management skills. 
Growth can mask a lack of planning or an inadequate orientation toward long-
term issues. Success can disguise a variety of shortcomings while breeding a 
dangerous form of arrogance.
The incentives for growth by a new venture are several, as summarized in 
Table 16.5. One incentive to grow is to attract capital investment to expand mar-
kets and product lines. Also, growth creates a sense of pride among the employ-
ees and provides opportunity for expanding financial reward.
A firm’s ability to use and coordinate new assets and activities depends on its 
organization and managerial capabilities. Rapid growth can challenge those capa-
bilities severely. It is important for a publicly held company to have consistent, 
predictable financial growth. Consistency requires controlled growth of assets 
and personnel additions. Growing a staff at a rate greater than 15 percent a year 
will challenge any organization. Paychex, Inc., is a $2 billion  payroll-processing 
firm that has increased revenues at an average of 18 percent for many years. 
With economies of scale, it has increased profits by 20 percent each year.
Most companies employ a mix of organic growth using both inside resources 
and external sources of resources. A balanced approach to growth attempts to 
break down barriers to growth and improve the company’s core competencies. 
Some firms, such as Palo Alto Networks and Salesforce, have been successful in 
building revenues at 30 percent or more per year while maintaining a balanced 
mix of internally and externally financed growth.
Most highly innovative firms become high-growth firms [Kirchhoff, 1994]. 
Microsoft, for example, grew its revenues at 29 percent per year for the decade 
1991 to 2001 and grew its profits at 35 percent per year for the same period.

Microsoft’s Quest for Growth
In 1975, two college students, Bill Gates and Paul Allen, began to develop 
and sell software that ran on the original personal computers (PCs). Soon 
they incorporated their firm as Microsoft. In 1981, industry giant IBM 
decided to enter the PC market and hired Microsoft to develop an operating 
system. Microsoft quickly created DOS, which became the dominant operat-
ing system in the industry. In March of 1986, Microsoft raised $61 million

16.4   Managing Revenue Growth 361
Apple grew its revenues at 44 percent per year for the decade 2003 to 2012 and 
grew its profits at 51 percent per year for the same period.
The sources of revenue growth for a firm can include increasing brand rec-
ognition and international expansion, as shown in Table 16.6. Very few firms 
are able to increase prices in the face of tough competition. New offerings of 
valuable products are a good source of revenue growth. Successful companies 
active in new product offerings are Apple and Google.
The market value of a firm can be described as a result of three drivers, 
as shown in Figure 16.7 [Rappaport et al., 2001]. Changes in volume, price, 
and sales mix lead to changes in sales growth rate. Operating profit margin 
(profit before taxes divided by revenues) is driven by four factors, as shown 
in Figure 16.7. Incremental investment rate is the result of investment effi-
ciencies. Operating leverage is the ratio of profit margin increases to upfront 
preproduction expenses for new product development and capacity expan-
sion. Accounting for all these factors, a firm seeks to increase its efficient use 
in its initial public offering of stock. In 1992, Microsoft announced the third 
version of Windows, marking the end of its collaboration with IBM on oper-
ating systems. Windows allowed Microsoft to expand its offerings of appli-
cations, greatly enhancing its revenue generation.
Applications made by Microsoft continue to generate significant rev-
enue for the company. Products such as the Office Suite and Explorer con-
tinue to be ubiquitous on computers around the world, despite increasing 
challenges from open source competitors. In late 2001, Microsoft built on 
its strength in the computer gaming industry by entering the game console 
market. Eventually, Xbox 360 gained market share to become a popular 
console alongside Sony’s PlayStation 3 and Nintendo’s Wii. The Xbox 
allows Microsoft to gain additional revenue through the sale of games.
Microsoft has cleverly added revenue streams over the years, while con-
tinuing to play to its core competencies as a software development firm. Cur-
rent forays, such as its Zune music products and smartphone technologies, 
seek to add revenue growth to the firm in the future. Microsoft is currently 
the #1 software company in the world, a position it has maintained for most 
of the last 30 years. In 2013, Microsoft’s market capitalization was more 
than $290 billion with revenues of $78 billion. This valuation reflects over 
three decades of sustained profitability and continuous revenue growth.

16.5   The Harvest Plan 363
16.5 The Harvest Plan
Assuming a successful venture, investors will want to know the plan for 
providing a cash return. A harvest plan defines how and when the own-
ers and investors will extract some of the economic value from the invest-
ment. Professional investors will expect a return on their investments within 
five to seven years. Thus, investors will expect a plan for cash liquidity for 
themselves. Note, however, that “harvest” does not mean the challenges and 
responsibility of the business are over.
For high-growth firms, the value created by an innovative venture can 
lead to significant returns over a four- to ten-year period, depending on the 
industry and market conditions. Both the founders and the investors will 
desire to access the financial return accrued by the new growing firm at the 
end of that period. This will mean some action will be necessary to yield a 
cash flow from the firm to the investors and owners. Table 16.7 lists five 
methods of harvesting a firm. The sale of the entrepreneurial firm to an 
acquiring firm is an attractive route for the founders and investors. Proceeds 
from the sale of a private company usually consist of cash, shares of the 
 acquiring company, or a combination of shares and cash.
Fast-growing companies with annual revenues greater than $20 million may 
find a solution in the public stock market by using an initial public offering (IPO). 
If the investors are patient, the issuance of cash dividends to individuals can 
serve to provide cash to the investors. Of course, it is often possible to arrange a 
sale of the firm to the managers and employees of the firm. Finally, many owners 
of relatively small firms will consider passing the firm on to family successors.
The selection of a harvest strategy will depend on the interests of the  founders 
and investors. Professional investors such as venture capitalists expect large annu-
alized returns and normally seek the issuance of an initial public offering by year 
five or six. Alternately, the venture may be acquired by another,  typically larger, 
firm that provides the liquidity sought by the  professional investors.
The entrepreneurial team may describe an exit strategy for their venture after 
a specified period. This plan will be part of the negotiation with the investors.
A planned sale to employees and managers may be outlined in the business 
plan. This transfer can use an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). The firm

CHAPTER 16   Profit and Harvest364
from a bank, and the cash is used to buy the owner’s stock. The shares of the 
firm are held by a trust, and the company makes annual tax-deductible contri-
butions to the trust so it can pay off the loan. As the loan is paid off, shares are 
released and allocated to the employees. While an ESOP benefits the owner by 
providing a market for selling stock, it also carries with it some tax advantages 
that make the approach attractive to owner and employees alike.
Few events in the life of the entrepreneur or the firm are more significant than 
the harvest. Without the opportunity to harvest, a firm’s owners and investors will 
be denied a significant amount of the value that has been created over the firm’s 
life. The founders may need a harvest strategy due to a desire to retire or diversify 
their portfolio of assets. Investors may need to realize their returns to invest them 
elsewhere or benefit in other ways. The timing of the harvest may be uncertain, 
but a harvest strategy does help the entrepreneur team plan together for the future.
A good time to sell a company is when it is very successful. When that time 
arrives, it may be best to review or exercise the harvest plan. At that time, a firm 
needs to determine a realistic valuation for the firm and obtain advice from its board 
of directors. Entrepreneurs often choose to sell for personal, nonfinancial reasons, 
such as burnout from the long hours and high stress of running their own businesses. 
Entrepreneurs who have raised money from family and friends may be especially 
eager to sell, since they feel a heightened pressure to return their investors’ money. 
Moreover, entrepreneurs typically have much of their personal wealth tied up in a 
single company, making them eager to sell so they can diversify their holdings.
When entrepreneurs decide to sell, their choice of buyers is about more than 
price. Company leaders often choose buyers based on “soft” criteria such as stra-
tegic and organizational fit. They care about the fate of their employees as well as 
whether their strategic vision will be carried on. It is rare for entrepreneurs to hold 
a formal auction for their company; instead, they hold informal discussions with a 
small number of potential buyers with whom they see a good fit [Graebner, 2004].
First Solar, Inc., was founded in 1999 by Harold McMaster. The company 
manufactures cadmium telluride-based thin-film solar panels. In 2006, the com-
pany became profitable and raised about $400 million in its IPO. Subsequently, 
the founders sold some of their shares as a way to harvest a portion of their 
gains. They retained ownership of the majority of their stock, but had the alter-
native of liquidating shares in the future.
AIR: A Successful Harvest
In 1994, David Edwards, a postgraduate researcher in Robert Langer’s lab at 
MIT, began working on a novel drug delivery system that used large, porous 
particles to deliver drugs directly to the lungs. Although the technology was 
entering a seemingly crowded market, Edwards’s idea had the potential to 
perform significantly better than other forms of inhalation delivery sys-
tems. From the technology’s initial stages, Langer, who had founded several 
successfully biotechnology firms, recognized the commercial potential of

16.5   The Harvest Plan 365
Edwards’s idea, but an attempt in 1995 to license the technology to a public 
drug delivery firm was unsuccessful.
Reluctant to start his own company when the technology was still pre-
liminary, Edwards left MIT in early 1995 for a faculty position at Penn-
sylvania State University. While at Penn State, he continued to refine the 
delivery system and to visit Langer at MIT about once a month. By early 
1997, Edwards and Langer were sufficiently pleased with their progress to 
approach Terry McGuire, a Harvard Business School graduate and recent 
founder of Polaris Ventures. Langer knew McGuire because he had invested 
in several of Langer’s ideas. McGuire was initially hesitant to invest in the 
novel technology, which was entering a crowded market. His faith in Langer, 
however, as both a stellar scientist and entrepreneur, along with an influen-
tial Science article and external affirmation of the importance of Edwards’s 
technology, convinced McGuire to put aside his uncertainty. In the summer 
of 1997, McGuire invested $250,000 in return for 11 percent of Advanced 
Inhalation Research (AIR) and an option to purchase an additional 9 percent. 
McGuire took on the role of temporary CEO, and Edwards took a leave of 
absence from Penn State to return to Boston to work on the idea full time. 
In January 1998, the company opened its headquarters in Cambridge, Mas-
sachusetts. The first three employees were all previously affiliated with the 
chemical engineering department at MIT.
Once established in their new offices, Langer and Edwards quickly went 
to work on their first human clinical trial. As their science progressed, so too 
did interest from outside parties. The founders decided on a two-tier strat-
egy. For drugs that had gone off patent, they would manufacture generic 
versions of the drugs themselves. For newly developed drugs, AIR would 
partner with leading pharmaceutical firms to exclusively manufacture the 
drugs for the delivery system. McGuire focused on successfully closing the 
deals with minimal dilution of Polaris’s stake in the firm.
For a nascent firm, AIR was extremely successful. It had raised capi-
tal for an early-stage technology, was making progress in its clinical trials, 
and was forming favorable partnerships. Nevertheless, when suitors began 
knocking at the door, AIR needed to consider their offers seriously. To con-
tinue to grow, AIR would need to scale up its operations significantly and 
move from a small R & D firm to a larger manufacturing operation. This 
task was extremely difficult and one that only a small handful of biotech-
nology firms had achieved. In late 1998, just a year and a half after AIR 
was founded, Alkermes offered to acquire the firm. In February 1999, AIR 
agreed to Alkermes’s offer of an all-stock deal valued around $125 million. 
The deal was considered a success on all sides. Polaris received a healthy 
return on its investment, AIR’s technology was a strategic fit for Alkermes’s 
existing drug delivery systems, and Alkermes’s savvy management team 
and established reputation in the industry allowed it to find the most appro-
priate partner for AIR.

All three founders remain active in the biotechnology industry. Edwards, 
now a professor at Harvard University, cofounded Pulmatrix in the spring of 
2003 and has been involved in the formation of a number of nonprofit orga-
nizations. McGuire remains a general partner with Polaris Ventures and has 
invested in other early-stage life science firms. Finally, Langer continues to 
be wildly prolific. He holds more than 800 granted and pending patents, has 
licensed his technology to more than 100 firms, and was named one of the 
100 most important people by CNN and Time magazine.

16.6 Exit and Failure
A large percentage of new ventures shut down within a few years of initiation. 
Some terminate their efforts when they fail to achieve the original goals; others ter-
minate when they simply run out of cash. Most entrepreneurs and investors assert 
that new ventures fail because of inadequate management skills, a poor strategy, 
and inadequate capitalization as well as poor market conditions [Zacharakis et al., 
1999]. For most entrepreneurs, an inadequate team with inadequate past experi-
ence leads to failure.
Many people learn from business failure by revising their knowledge and 
assumptions about their skills [Shepherd, 2003]. Learning can be measured in 
terms of an increased understanding of why the business failed, in an effort to 
prevent repeating the same mistakes. Often entrepreneurs are overconfident and 
unrealistically overrate their knowledge and skills. They discount the risks inher-
ent in a new venture. Furthermore, they may exaggerate their ability to control 
events and people. Examples of highly visible failures in telecommunications 
are Helio and Amp’d Mobile.
Knowing when to stop or terminate a venture may be as important as know-
ing when to start. The concept of sunk is that a cost that has already incurred 
cannot be affected by any present or future decisions. In other words, funds and 
time invested on a new venture are already gone, regardless of any action you 
take today or later. If a new venture has not worked out as planned, one should 
look at proceeding with the venture as a new decision, as shown in Figure 16.8. 
The decision to terminate or continue should, if possible, be looked at afresh 
with the information at hand. If a venture has run out of cash and the market has 
not responded to the new venture, it may be wise to exit the venture.
Pandesic was a joint venture of SAP and Intel designed to develop informa-
tion architectures for Internet companies. Founded in 1997, Pandesic intended 
to create a unique e-business solution that would automate the entire business 
process for companies doing business on the Internet. By March 1997, Pandesic 
had grown to 100 employees. By the end of 1997, sales were slowly appearing, 
and by 1998, it was still struggling without many sales. By April 1999, the sales 
force was reorganized. As a result, sales started to grow, but the firm was still

unprofitable. Pandesic had 400 employees and 100 customers by mid-2000, but 
it was still experiencing negative cash flow (said to be $80 million per year) and 
closed its doors in July 2000. The decision to terminate was based on large cash 
losses and recognition that profitability was not within reach [Girard, 2000].
If the decision is to continue, it may be wise to consider the next phase of the 
company as a turnaround and devise deliberate interventions that increase the 
level of communication, collaboration, and respect among all the participants 
[Kanter, 2003].
If the decision is to terminate the new venture, it is best to try to learn from 
it. Ideally, it is the venture that failed, not the people in it. Picking oneself up, 
learning from the venture, and then moving on is the best process. Every exit is 
an entry somewhere else.
The alternative of investing more time and money should be based on rational 
recognition of the sunk costs and the potential for recovery and success. An entre-
preneur can examine the situation afresh and decide if the opportunity still looks 
good enough to invest more time and money.
16.7 Spotlight on Baidu
Robin Li and Eric Xu incorporated Baidu in January 2000. Baidu is a Web ser-
vices company headquartered in Beijing, China. It offers Internet search and 
information services in the Chinese language.
Baidu has a revenue model based on advertising revenues. Most of these 
revenues are linked to online shopping, a growing market in China. Baidu also is 
growing in the mobile-device and cloud-storage markets.

16.8 Summary
A new firm formulates its revenue model to clearly describe how it will gener-
ate and grow its revenues. Revenues are important, but positive cash flow and 
profitability are critical to ultimate success. Thus, cost and profit models that can 
be readily implemented must be created early in a firm’s planning. Profit does 
not occur naturally but rather flows from value shared with the customer. Thus, 
enough customers must experience high value and find that the firm is the best, 
if not the only, provider of this value.
Managing revenue growth to match the growth of cash flow is important to 
achieve organic, internally funded growth. Otherwise, the new firm must con-
stantly seek new financial resources from investors and lenders. Many firms find 
it necessary to terminate their activities when they are unable to access new 
sources of funds. With positive results and reasonable growth, a firm should 
consider a plan to harvest the rewards so that all owners receive a financial 
return on their investment.

16.1 A company’s value chain was discussed in Section 14.1. Figure 16.1 
outlines the division between profit and cost. Extend Figure 16.1 
to account for the profits and costs of partners and suppliers in a 
 company’s value chain.
16.2 Google uses a complex revenue model and a related profit engine. It has a 
large base of users and advertisers, and works to link its users to retailers. 
Describe its revenue and profit model. Contrast this with Yahoo’s revenue 
model. Examining recent quarterly reports will give an indication of the 
“split” of revenue among business units.
16.3 Zipcar gives its members short-term, on-demand use of a fleet 
of cars (www.zipcar.com). Before launching this service, Zipcar pro-
posed a pricing scheme of a $300 refundable security deposit, 
a $300 annual subscription fee, and $1.50 per hour plus 40 cents per 
mile. Create another pricing scheme that will be more profitable.
16.4 Skype offers Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephony services 
and PC to PC calling. The telephone service began as a free service. 
Describe the revenue and profit model for Skype specifically. Has its 
acquisition by Microsoft changed Skype’s revenue model?
16.5 Salesforce.com sells software as a service delivered online. Corporations 
pay about $60 per month for each user (www.salesforce.com). Describe 
its revenue model and profit model.
16.6 Research and determine the most profitable industry sector in a country 
of interest (profitability on either a relative or absolute basis). What is 
driving this high profitability? Is it sustainable, and for how long?
16.7 Compare the most recent yearly income statements for Microsoft, 
Apple, Dell, Sony, and Qualcomm. Examine the gross margins 
for each of these companies (cost of goods sold divided by rev-
enue). Complete a similar ratio analysis against Sales, General & 
Administrative (SG&A) and Research & Development (R&D). When 
normalized against revenues, what do these ratios tell us about the 
strategies and operations of these companies?

How do entrepreneurs describe the financial 
elements of their new venture? 
E
ntrepreneurs build a financial plan to 
 determine the economic potential for their 
venture. This plan provides an estimate of 
the potential of the venture. Of course, any esti-
mate is based on a set of assumptions regarding 
sales revenues and costs. Using the best available 
information and their intuition, entrepreneurs cal-
culate the potential profitability of the venture. 
Furthermore, they need to determine the flow of 
cash monthly to identify the cash investments that 
will be required over a two- or three-year period. 
An income statement and a balance sheet also are 
required to demonstrate profitability and liquidity.
Using the estimates of sales, the venture team 
can determine the number of units it needs to sell 
to break even. Furthermore, it can calculate sev-
eral measures of profitability that demonstrate the 
return provided by its venture for investors. The 
best ventures grow sales consistently and provide 
positive cash flow and profit early in their life.

CHAPTER 17   The Financial Plan372
A sound business plan is based on a solid vision and a business design or concept. 
It is an expression of the theory of the business in the form of a story. This story 
also needs to make sense financially as a business model. The business model 
tells a story about the customer and the value proposition that leads to revenue and 
profit. To create this value for the customer, a new firm needs to build a financial 
plan that describes the expected revenues, cash flows, profits, and investments 
necessary to achieve them. The purpose of any business is to create value for its 
customers and to generate a return on investment for its owners. A financial plan 
provides an estimate of projected cash flow and return on investment.
To create a financial plan, entrepreneurs must clearly state their assumptions 
about sales and costs. What resources will it take, over what time frame, to achieve 
expected sales and profitability? The calculation of cash flows is based on a set of 
assumptions, which we will call the base case, that portrays the most likely out-
comes. It may be prudent to also determine the outcome of a situation in which the 
expectations are not realized as expected, called the pessimistic case. Cash flow is 
the amount of cash flowing into or out of a firm during a specific period. It is arrived 
at by subtracting the amount paid out in dividends from the net profit and then add-
ing back noncash expenses such as depreciation. See Table 17.10 at the end of this 
chapter for a glossary of accounting and financial terms.
The entrepreneurs’ goal is to develop a solid set of financial projections 
that will include a pro forma income statement. Pro forma means provided in 
advance of actual data. Pro forma statements are forecasts of financial outcomes. 
The creation of a set of financial projections starts with a sales forecast based on 
a set of assumptions regarding the customer and sales growth. Then the calcula-
tion of projected sales over a two- or three-year period can be developed. This is 
step 1, as shown in Table 17.1. The second step is to state the assumed costs of 
doing business in the time frame described in step 1. In step 2, the costs associ-
ated with the projected sales can be calculated. Step 3 is to calculate the expected 
income and cash flow forecast over the time frame based on a set of assumptions 
regarding the timing of sales and receipts as well as payables to vendors and 
others. The final step is to calculate the balance sheet on an annual basis for the 
two- or three-year period. The balance sheet at the starting point of the new ven-
ture will need to be described by stating the assumed starting investments and 
required assets. Please visit this textbook’s websites for tools and links useful 
towards building a financial plan.
The cash flows, assets, balance sheet, and revenue projections are all intercon-
nected through linkages. Accounting items are classified into “accounts” accord-
ing to their nature, translated into monetary units, and organized in statements. The 
basic accounting formula is
Assets 5 liabilities 1 equity
where assets are what the company owns and liabilities are the amounts it owes 
to other persons or entities. Equity is the company’s net worth (book value) 
expressed as

17.1   Building a Financial Plan 373
Equity 5 assets 2 liabilities
Equity is the ownership of the firm, usually divided into certificates called 
common or preferred shares of stock. The assets and liabilities are linked to 
income and expenses, as shown in Figure 17.1. Assets are used to generate 
income, and liabilities require expenses such as rent, payments, or return of 
loans. Book value is the firm’s net worth and is often called accounting value. 
Market value is share price times the number of issued shares. Note that book 
value is not equal to market value, which is the perceived value of the firm given 
its growth potential.
The financial plan is critical to the evaluation of the business model of the 
new venture. With sound assumptions, the projected results will help in evaluat-
ing the venture and its financial viability. The resulting financial plan is only 
as good as the quality of the assumptions. One reason forecasting models are 
so fallible is that they rely on the assumptions that the user chooses to input 
[Riggs, 2004].
New firms should select two or three parameters of the business that display 
the greatest impact on the cash flows of the business. Examples are sales growth 
rate and new customer acquisition rate. They should then test the changes in 
sales as each of these parameters is changed. Analysis of these sensitivity results 
will allow for more focus and better decision making.

Sales projections will normally be developed for a two- or three-year period on 
a monthly basis. The sales forecast for a new venture is often the weakest link in 
the financial plan. Since the new venture has not actually obtained sales, the firm 
can only work with assumptions based on inadequate  information.
In this chapter, consider a fictitious new venture, named e-Travel. It seeks 
to sell travel guide books (e-books) directly to readers who will download the 
guides via the Internet and read them on their tablets or other devices. Short 
books such as these travel guides operate on a pull model, since customers 
order them only when they wish to read them. This is opposite of the usual push 
model, in which the publisher prints the book and then tries to find a purchaser. 
For travelers, a tablet is easier to use than several heavy books. Using keywords 
such as “pizza restaurant Denver,” the reader can use the search function to get 
the information quickly.
The new venture needs to build a financial plan. The first step is to build 
the sales projections. e-Travel has created a network of the best authors of travel 
guides. These authors have signed publisher agreements and have provided 
e-Travel with electronic guides to over five hundred cities, regions, and leisure and 
recreation destinations throughout the world. All these guides are written follow-
ing a common format, and key search words are identified.

## Page 398

17.5   Cash Flow Statement 375
e-Travel expects to sell 1,200 guides starting in the third month of operation. 
The price per guide is $15, paid by credit card when the guide is ordered online. 
Based on market research, the expected growth rate of sales is 10 percent per 
month. The pessimistic growth rate is 1 percent per month. The sales projections 
for the expected growth rate are shown in Table 17.2 for a three-year period. 
Assuming a 10 percent growth rate per month, sales amount to over $3 million 
in year three. Note the bolded ovals for key results in tables.
17.3 Costs Forecast
To determine the expected costs of doing business, the new venture team must 
examine its needs for facilities, equipment, and employees. Our example business, 
e-Travel, will need an office, computers, software, and office furniture. The authors 
will constantly update the information in their guides and will receive royalties at 
12 percent of net revenues paid on the fifteenth day of the month  following the 
sale generated by their guides. The costs of doing business will include salaries, 
marketing, and communication costs, and normal office utilities and supplies. The 
cost assumptions for e-Travel are summarized in Table 17.3. Every new venture 
needs to construct a set of assumptions at a similar level of detail.
17.4 Income Statement
The income statement reports the economic results of a firm over a time 
period.  The income statement is calculated as shown in Figure 17.2 [Maher 
et al., 2004]. Note that operating expenses are often grouped into four general 
 categories: sales and marketing, general and administrative, research and devel-
opment, and depreciation. Other formats are acceptable.
The income (profit and loss) statement for e-Travel depicts the venture’s 
expected performance over a period of time—in this case, three years. The sales, 
costs, and profits or losses are shown monthly. The purpose of the income state-
ment is to show how much profit or loss is generated. Due to the online nature 
of e-Travel, it has no cost of goods sold. The profit and loss statement is shown 
in Table 17.4. The firm is profitable by the fifth month and shows a profit of 
$19,954 for the first year (for the base case).
17.5 Cash Flow Statement
The cash flow statement shows the actual flow of cash into and out of the 
 venture. The cash flow statement tracks when the venture actually receives and 
spends the cash. A venture with positive cash flow can continue to operate with-
out new debt or equity capital. If a cash flow statement reveals projected nega-
tive cash in some period, it will be necessary to plan for a new capital infusion. 
We define cash flow as the sum of retained earnings minus the depreciation 
provision made by a firm [Maher et al., 2004].

17.5   Cash Flow Statement 377
A growing business needs cash to operate. The detailed cash flow process 
is shown in Figure 17.3. Firms calculate their cash on hand at the end of each 
month. Therefore,
TC(N 1 1) 5 (CF 2 Disbursements) 1 TC(N)
where TC(N 1 1) is the cash at the end of month (N 1 1), TC(N) is the total 
cash at the end of month (N), and CF is the cash flow for the month.
The cash flow statement for e-Travel is provided in Table 17.5 (for the base 
case). It is assumed that the founders invest $140,000 in cash and obtain a bank 
loan of $100,000 secured by their personal assets. This $240,000 is for operations 
TABLE 17.3 Cost assumptions for e-Travel.
 ■ Author royalties: 12 percent of net revenues paid on the fifteenth of the month following 
the sale
 ■ Credit card: 1 percent to credit card providers, paid electronically as sale is processed 
 ■ Office rent: $1,500 per month
 ■ Physical assets (computers, furniture, etc.): $48,000 per year; four-year life
 ■ Depreciation of equipment (monthly):
Year 1 Year 2 Year 3
$1,000 $2,000 $3,000
 ■ Salaries (monthly):
 Year 1 Year 2 Year 3
President $4,000 $ 5,500 $ 6,500
Vice president 4,000 5,000 6,000
Administrative manager 1,500 3,000 3,500
(part time)
                              Total: $9,500 $13,500 $16,000
 ■ Social Security taxes and other benefits: 15 percent of total salaries
 ■ Marketing (monthly):
Year 1 Year 2 Year 3
$2,000 $2,500 $3,000
 ■ Utilities, supplies, travel, communication (monthly):
Year 1 Year 2 Year 3
$2,000 $3,000 $4,000
 ■ Interest expense: $1,000 per month ($100,000 loan at 12 percent per year; interest paid 
monthly; principal to be paid at end of five years)
 ■ Income taxes: 30 percent of income before taxes

CHAPTER 17   The Financial Plan378
and the initial purchase of long-term assets such as computers and furniture, as 
shown in month 1 of year 1 in Table 17.5. The initial investment of $240,000 can 
be considered an equity investment since the loan is personally guaranteed by the 
two founders. Under the base case assumption of 10 percent growth in revenues 
each month, the cash flow quickly becomes positive.

17.6 Balance Sheet
The new venture team should prepare a balance sheet at the opening of the busi-
ness and for the end of each year. The balance sheet depicts the conditions of the 
business by displaying the assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity of the business 
[Maher et al., 2004]. The format for a balance sheet is shown in Figure 17.4 for 
a business at the end of the year.

17.7   Results for a Pessimistic Growth Rate 381
The balance sheet for e-Travel is shown in Table 17.6. The balance sheet shows 
the assets, such as cash, equipment, furniture, and accumulated depreciation. The 
liabilities are the loan payable and the royalties to the authors.  Total owners’ equity 
consists of contributions of $140,000 and retained earnings. Table 17.6 shows the 
balance sheet at the end of month 1, year 1, year 2, and year 3. The base case  balance 
sheet provides evidence of the financial strength of e-Travel.
17.7 Results for a Pessimistic Growth Rate
Any new venture needs to plan for the likely case and prepare for the worst case. 
For e-Travel, we will assume the pessimistic case occurs when the sales grow 
at a rate of only 1 percent per month. The summary of the results for the pessi-
mistic case is shown in Table 17.7. Table 17.7A shows the sales projections for 
the first three years. Sales for year 3 are $284,010 for the pessimistic case, while 
they were estimated at $3,133,380 for the expected case. Table 17.7B shows the 
profit and loss statement for the pessimistic case. Note that the firm is not profit-
able in the pessimistic case in any year.

CHAPTER 17   The Financial Plan384
We show the cash flow statement for the pessimistic case in Table 17.7C. 
Notice that the ending cash balance turns negative in month 1 of year 3. The com-
pany would need a cash infusion in month 1 of year 3 to continue operating.
To be a profitable venture, e-Travel needs to attain a sales growth rate that 
exceeds 4 percent per month over the first two years. This figure can be deter-
mined by modifying the spreadsheet calculation with various growth rates.

17.8 Breakeven Analysis
In the initial stages of building a financial plan, it is useful to know when a profit 
may be achieved. Breakeven is defined as when the total sales equals the total 
costs. Total sales (R) are
R 5 Q 3 P
where Q 5 number of units sold and P 5 price per unit. Total cost (TC) is
TC 5 FC 1 VC
where FC 5 total fixed costs and VC 5 variable costs. Thus, breakeven is the 
volume of sales (Q) at which the venture will neither make a profit nor incur a loss. 
Sales in excess of the volume of sales needed to cover costs will result in a profit.
Total fixed costs are $221,100 for e-Travel in year 1 for the base case, and 
variable costs are 13 percent of sales, since royalty and credit card costs are 
12 percent and 1 percent, respectively. Then, to determine Q, we have

Therefore, after selling about 17,000 e-Travel guides, the firm is profitable.
17.9 Measures of Profitability
Investors in new ventures are interested in measures of annual return on 
their investment. The return on invested capital (ROIC) is the ratio of the 
net income earned each year expressed as a percentage of the total invested 
capital in the firm. The ROIC for 3M and IBM in 2013 was 20 percent and 
32 percent, respectively. It is also called return on investment (ROI). The 
ROI for a venture is
ROI 5 
net income
investment
where the income is distributed or allocated to the investor. As a firm grows, it 
may not actually distribute cash to its investors for some period. In that case, it 
is retaining earnings and using the retained cash earnings as investment capital. 
Then the retained earnings are added to the original equity investments to yield 
the owners’ equity [Riggs, 2004].
Net income and owners’ equity can provide the ratio called return on 
equity (ROE). ROE is calculated as
ROE 5 
net income
owners’equity
Using Tables 17.4 and 17.6, the return on equity for e-Travel for year 2 is
ROE 5 $393,606
$553,560  3 100% 5 71.1%
Investor (owner) returns can be calculated at the time of distribution of cash 
or when the equity is priced in a public market. Assuming the ownership held by 
the original investors in e-Travel can be sold at the end of year 3 for $720,000, 
the multiple (M) achieved by the investor group is
M 5 
$720,000
$240,000  5 3.0

CHAPTER 17   The Financial Plan390
The annual compound return over the three years is 44.2 percent, since 
(1.442)3 5 3.0. Therefore, the annual return on investment (ROI) is
ROI 5 44.2%
Note that we designate the investment as $240,000 since that original investment 
is the total investment by the founders. We consider a loan countersigned per-
sonally as equivalent to an equity investment by the founders.

17.10 Spotlight on SolarCity
SolarCity is a provider of energy sources to home owners, businesses, and gov-
ernment organizations. SolarCity provides the design, installs the system, and 
provides analysis of energy needs and services to meet the needs of the custom-
ers. The largest barrier to adoption of solar power systems is the up-front cost, 
which can reach $30,000 for a system for a larger home. SolarCity employs a 
unique financial model to overcome this barrier. First, they rely on U.S govern-
ment grants to pay for a significant portion of the total costs for installation 
of a system. Second, SolarCity leases the system to the customer rather than 
relying solely upon up-front payments. As the solar systems operate, customers 
normally receive more power than needed and can sell this surplus power back 
to their utility company. These surplus sales, in turn, can cover part of the lease 
TABLE 17.8 Top 10 accounting principles for entrepreneurs.
 1.   The fundamental equation inherent in financial statements is: Assets = Liabilities + 
Owners’ Equity.
 2.   The balance sheet is a snapshot at a moment in time of financial position, while the 
income statement reports on financial performance for a period.
 3.  An income statement details changes in retained earnings for the period.
 4.  Accounting disputes turn almost solely on valuation and timing.
 5.   Five key principles govern valuation: Realization (accrual), conservatism, consistency, 
materiality, and historic cost.
 6.  Since valuations require judgments, financial statements are necessarily only estimates.
 7.   “Book values” seldom equal “market values,” particularly for long-term assets and 
owners’ equity.
 8.  The lifeblood of any operation is cash.
 9.  Ratios are the key tool for drawing meaning from financial statements.
 10.   A company’s ability to finance its growth internally is a function of its return on equity.

A sound financial plan demonstrates the potential for growth and profit-
ability for a new venture and is based on the most accurate and reliable 
assumptions available.
payment to SolarCity. Thus, many customers may find that their total cost is 
almost negligible.
SolarCity’s financial model is attractive; however, SolarCity experienced 
large costs in recent years. It could be a decade before SolarCity is able to 
achieve a strong return on its investment.
17.11 Summary
The entrepreneurial team builds its financial plan to determine the economic 
potential for its venture and demonstrate it to potential investors. The plan uses 
projected figures based on the underlying assumptions of the business venture. 
This plan shows the profit and loss statement and the cash flow statement, which 
can be used to draw up the balance sheet. Monthly figures are used for the first 
year or two and quarterly figures for the next two or three years. Furthermore, a 
calculation of the sale of the required number of units for breakeven will be use-
ful. The best new ventures are able to grow sales consistently and show positive 
cash flow and profit early in their lives.

17.3 Viscotech, Inc. is planning to enter the field of electro-optical systems 
for automated optical inspection and detection of defects in manufacturing 
components and modules. The projected financial revenues and income are 
shown in Table 17.9. The firm plans to start with an equity investment of 
$1,000,000 and a five-year loan of $500,000. Determine the cash on hand at 
the end of each year. Also, determine the return on equity and the return on 
investment for each year.
17.4 A new venture is launched with an initial investment (cash on hand) of 
$80,000. It generates sales of $40,000 each month. It has monthly oper-
ating costs of $36,000. The firm purchases equipment costing $30,000 
each month for the first 4 months. Calculate the return on investment at 
the end of 12 months. Determine if the cash on hand remains positive at 
the end of each month. What, if any, investment is required and when?
17.5 A software firm has fixed costs of $800,000 and variable costs of 
$12 per unit. Calculate the breakeven quantity (Q) when each unit sells 
for $50. If the firm sells 50,000 units in a year, what is its profit for that 
year? Assume the tax rate for the firm is 20 percent.
17.6 A new firm, Sensor International, is preparing a plan based on its new 
device to be used in a security network. The cost of manufacturing, 
marketing, and distributing a package of six sensors is 14 cents, and 
the price to the distributor is 68 cents. The firm calculates its one-time 
fixed costs at $121,000. Determine the number of units required for 
breakeven.
17.7 Continuing exercise 17.6, Sensor International sells 300,000 packages in 
its first year and 400,000 in its second. If the investor’s original investment 
was $100,000, determine the return on investment in year 1 and year 2 for 
the firm. Assume a tax rate of 20 percent. 
17.8 Reconsider the firm described in exercise 17.6 when it is determined 
that fixed costs have declined to $30,000 and the firm has determined 
by studies that it can only expect to sell 60 units this year. What price 
should it select to ensure selling the 60 units profitably?

Sources of Capital
Capital is to the progress of society what gas is to a car.
James Truslow Adams
What are the sources of capital that a new ven-
ture can use to finance the start and growth of 
its company? 
E
ntrepreneurs can estimate the capital required 
for their new business by reviewing the finan-
cial projections they prepare using the methods 
detailed in Chapter 17. In examining the projections and 
the cash flow statement, it becomes clear how much 
capital will be needed and when. This chapter addresses 
the task of attracting investors to a new business and 
creating an investment offering that will meet the firm’s 
needs and the investors’ requirements for an attractive 
return. In this chapter, we describe the funds that may 
be available from various sources. 
The entrepreneurs may provide some of the 
required capital, and friends and family may help with 
modest investments. Government grants, bootstrap-
ping, and crowdsourcing can also supply necessary 
capital to launch a venture. Debt financing from a bank 
or other financial institution may be another option. 
Most high-growth ventures that expect to grow to 
a significant scale will need outside capital from pro-
fessional investors, such as angels and venture capi-
talists. Typically, several stages of investment will be 
required over the life of the business. The entrepreneurs 
also must determine what percentage ownership is 
offered to the investors. This determination is based on 
the valuation of the new business at each stage.
Mature ventures use an initial public offering (IPO) 
to raise additional growth capital and to offer early 
investors a means of harvesting the value created in an 
emerging firm. Preparation for an IPO can be an impor-
tant milestone for a firm with solid growth  potential.

CHAPTER 18   Sources of Capital396
18.1 Financing the New Venture
The financial projections for a new venture, as described in Chapter 17, provide 
the entrepreneur with an estimate of the cash flow over the first two or three 
years. From the cash-flow statement, the entrepreneurial team can determine the 
requirement for financial capital. Some new firms are cash-flow positive almost 
immediately, and the entrepreneurs themselves can provide the necessary start-
up funds. On the other hand, if it takes one year or more for the cash flow to 
become positive, a sizable investment may be necessary. Most high-tech firms 
take several years to become cash-flow positive.
A new venture may require capital to purchase fixed assets such as comput-
ers and manufacturing equipment. Furthermore, a new business needs capital to 
operate while building a customer base. Working capital is the capital used to 
support a firm’s normal operations and is defined as current assets minus cur-
rent liabilities. Financial capital is necessary to permit a new venture to purchase 
assets and provide working capital. As a firm grows, its needs for financial capi-
tal will normally increase. Choosing the right sources of capital for a business 
can be as important as choosing the team members and the location of the busi-
ness. This decision will influence the future of the firm.
Finding the capital they need can be a difficult and time-consuming task for 
entrepreneurs. Getting and completing an investment agreement can take 3 to 12 
months. For many entrepreneurs, it may be wise to first secure a few customers 
and then seek investors. Finding the right financial backer takes a good business 
plan and time. It will be necessary to continuously tell the venture’s story and 
answer myriad questions. However, revealing proprietary information under-
standably makes entrepreneurs uneasy. The chance that important information 
will leak to competitors is real.
Many investors take a long time reviewing the plan and interviewing the 
team, only to turn down the proposal in the end. The entrepreneur must assume 
a tentative deal will not be consummated and keep looking for investors even 
when one investor is seriously interested. While it’s tempting to end the hard 
work of finding money, continuing the search not only saves time if one deal 
falls through but also strengthens the negotiating position.
Financial capital for new ventures is available, but the key is knowing where 
to look. Entrepreneurs must do their homework before attempting to raise money 
for their ventures. Understanding which sources of funding are best suited to the 
various stages of a company’s growth and then learning how those sources oper-
ate are essential to success.
The issue of how much money to seek is difficult to resolve. Entrepreneurs 
wish investors to provide all the money necessary before positive cash flow. 
However, most investors want to divide their investment into several milestone-
based stages. Furthermore, most investors will be wary of the pro forma projec-
tions and tend to accept only the pessimistic projection or variations. Investors 
attempt to factor uncertainty into their calculations, while entrepreneurs are, by 
nature, more optimistic.

18.1   Financing the New Venture 397
An idealized cash-flow diagram appears in Figure 18.1. This new enterprise 
has a burn rate of $100,000 per month in the first 20 months. It starts generating 
positive cash flow in the twenty-first month and reaches cumulative cash break-
even in the thirty-fifth month. This firm would require an investment of at least 
$2 million.
Uncertainty of venture outcomes can lead to a wide range of estimates of 
results. Breaking a firm’s development into several stages can help investors build 
confidence in the firm over time. However, staged investments require the entre-
preneur to raise funds several times—a potentially distracting and risky effort.
Often the two parties, investors and entrepreneurs, possess asymmetrical 
information. The investors may know more about the industry, while the entre-
preneurs may know more about the venture. Furthermore, it may be difficult 
for the investors to determine an appropriate value for the intellectual property 
of the new venture. What is a patent worth? Often one finds out in court. Fur-
thermore, how does one value the team’s capabilities? Finally, the dynamics of 
the marketplace are difficult to assess. For example, the marketplace can pro-
vide different valuation multiples as the market mood changes. In turn, these 
factors lead to different perceptions by investors and entrepreneurs [Gompers 
and Lerner, 2001].

CHAPTER 18   Sources of Capital398
The process of securing investment capital requires that the effects of the 
first four factors shown in Table 18.1 be reduced in the negotiation stage. This 
can be done through a full discussion of the risks, clear goals, and value of 
intellectual property and the leadership team. Also, the investors must build 
confidence that the entrepreneurs can properly manage the firm within the 
dynamics of the marketplace. Finally, it should be recognized by both parties 
that the entrepreneurs will have their financial wealth concentrated in the ven-
ture, while the investors will have a set of diversified investments. The goal 
of the entrepreneurs is to find investors who examine the factors in Table 18.1 
and eventually align their view of these factors with those of the entrepreneurs. 
These investors can be called aligned investors.  Entrepreneurs are advised to 
find aligned investors since they will be responsive to changing needs and pro-
vide required flexibility. Identifying aligned investors who have industry, operat-
ing, and team-building expertise is a critical first step in successful fundraising.
TABLE 18.1  Five factors that lead to the different perceptions 
of investors and entrepreneurs.
 ■ Uncertainty of projected outcomes
 ■ Asymmetrical information
 ■ Assigning a value to intellectual prop-
erty and intangibles
 ■ Dynamics of the industry and the finan-
cial marketplace
 ■ Concentration of wealth risk in a venture 
by entrepreneurs while investors will 
have risk spread through a diversified 
portfolio
18.2 Venture Investments as Real Options
Investors make capital investments in opportunities for future cash returns. Pro-
fessional investors often think of an opportunity as an option. Options may be 
defined as rights but not obligations to take some action in the future. Invest-
ments in new ventures can be viewed as investments in opportunities with 
an uncertain outcome. An investment carries many risks, but also may create 
unforeseen opportunities that can be exploited in the future. A sound practice in 
the early stages of developing a business is to keep a number of options open by 
committing investments only in stages while exploring multiple business paths. 
Once uncertainty has been reduced to a tolerable level and widespread consen-
sus exists within the organization on an appropriate path, the full commitment to 
that path can be made. Investors who hold options are given the right to make a 
decision now or at a later date. They can exercise that right to either proceed to 
the next step or cut their losses and decide to cease investing.
In financial terms, an option is simply the right to purchase an asset at some 
future date and at a predetermined price. A real option is the right to invest in 
(or purchase) a real asset—shares in a start-up at a future date.

18.2   Venture Investments as Real Options 399
Christopher Columbus developed a plan to seek out exotic spices and 
develop a spice trade to Europe. He was an Italian sea captain who submit-
ted, without success, a proposal to the king of Portugal in 1484 to reach 
Asia by sailing west. Over the next four years, he made inquiries of many 
European courts. Finally, in 1492, after years of fruitless effort, he received 
the support of Queen Isabella and the Court of Madrid. The court invested 
1.4 million maravedis (currency of the time), and Columbus invested 250,000 
maravedis, mostly obtained from friends and family. The contract called for 
his designation as “admiral” and receipt of one-eighth of the profits from 
of all gold, silver, gems, and spices produced or mined in “his dominions.”
Columbus returned to Spain in March 1493 with some gold and a large 
amount of information about how to get to the “New World.” Queen Isa-
bella had purchased a real option on the discovery of gold and spices. As a 
result of Columbus’s discovery, she decided to exercise the option and send 
Columbus, Pizzaro, and Cortez to the New World to find and bring back 
fabulous wealth to Spain. Centuries later, today’s professional investors are 
often purchasing a real option in a start-up. For example, Peter Thiel, Jim 
Breyer, and Accel partners did so in Facebook in 2005.
Columbus and the Queen’s Option
Let’s consider a simplified mathematical model of venture investments. 
Intellectual capital (knowledge) can be transformed to economic capital to 
increase or create cash flows as well as strategic capital to exploit new opportu-
nities. We state that economic capital is the intrinsic value of the series of cash 
flows. The strategic capital is the option value (OV).
We may state broadly that the value of an investment in a new venture (V) is
V 5 IV 1 OV
where IV 5 intrinsic value and OV 5 option value.
Net present value (NPV) is the present value of the future cash flow of a 
venture discounted at an appropriate rate (r). The intrinsic value of a venture is 
the net present value (NPV) of the venture using a discount rate (r), equal to the 
expected return for the venture.
The net present value of a series of cash flow (c
n) is

years might be

where r 5 0.15, the discount rate for this firm. The initial cash flow is  negative 
since an investment of $100,000 was required at n 5 0. Then we may  calculate 
NPV as
NPV 5 2100,000 1 65,000(0.870) 1 35,000(0.756)
5 2100,000 1 83,000
5 $ 2 17,000
The intrinsic value (IV) is equal to NPV for this case. However, the investor 
has an option to reinvest in the firm after the first two years. Typically, inves-
tors establish options by making an initial investment in a venture, which grants 
them an option to invest again later. As information flows over time, the uncer-
tainty is reduced, and later-stage investments can be seen as less risky.
The value of an option (OV) is a function of four factors: the life of the 
option (T), the volatility (or uncertainty) of the price of the underlying asset (s), 
the discount rate (r), and the level of the exercise price (X), relative to the cur-
rent price of the venture (P). Clearly, having a longer period of time in which 
to decide whether or not to exercise an option increases the likelihood that the 
value of the firm will in the future exceed the exercise price. The higher the 
degree of uncertainty about the future value of the venture, the more one should 
be willing to pay for the option. The uncertainty can be represented by the stan-
dard deviation of the firm’s price (s) over the period (T). If the firm is new, use 
the standard deviation for comparable firms.
The value of an option increases with the relative value of the current stock 
price at the initial investment (P) to the exercise price of the option (X). The ratio 
P/X increases as X declines. The value of an option also increases with the dis-
count rate (r), since higher discount rates make the option more valuable due to 
high discounting of future cash flows. The four factors contributing to the value 
of a real option are summarized in Table 18.2.
The value of the option is based on the four factors T, s, P/X, and r. Then 
the option value is
OV 5 f (T, s, P/X, r)
which increases as all four factors increase. The option value can be calculated 
using the Black-Scholes formula [Boer, 2002]. An option calculator is available 
at http://www.mystockoptions.com/black-scholes.cfm. Another valuation model 
for options is the binomial model, which uses a decision tree format [Copeland 
and Tufano, 2004].
TABLE 18.2 Value of a real option based on four factors.
 ■ Increases with the level of uncertainty 
measured by the standard deviation (s)

person holding the option has to decide 
whether or not to exercise it
 ■ Increases with the ratio of the current 
stock price (P) to the exercise price (X) 
or P/X.

18.3   Sources and Types of Capital 401
As a first approximation, we can use a linear approximation for OV as 
follows:
OV 5 k1T 1 k2s 1 k3(P/X) 1 k4r
where ki are unspecified constants. For high relative values of the four factors, 
the option value will be significant and may exceed the NPV for the first few 
years of a high-risk venture.
Let us again consider the hypothetical case discussed in the preceding para-
graphs. An initial investment of $100,000 was made with an option to invest in a 
second round of investments after two years. Thus, consider the case where the 
period (T) is relatively long, the uncertainty (standard deviation) of the firm’s 
value is high, and the discount rate is relatively high. Also, if the current stock 
price of the firm at the time of the initial investment is low, say $10, and if the 
exercise price is preset at $5, then the option value is quite high. Perhaps an inves-
tor could estimate an option value of $50,000. Then the value of the  investment is
V 5 IV 1 OV
5 2$17,000 1 50,000 5 1$33,000
Often, the value of an investment in a start-up is largely its real option value.
Genentech was founded in 1976 by entrepreneur Robert Swanson and bio-
chemist Herbert Boyer to use gene-splicing technology to develop new phar-
maceuticals. Genentech, devoid of profit, went public in 1980 and raised 
$35 million. With little cash flow in sight, Genentech was valued solely on 
its potential to exploit its intellectual property and introduce important new 
pharmaceuticals. Genentech became profitable in 1993, and was acquired by 
Roche in 2009.
Early Valuation of Genentech
Investments that appear overly risky from a purely financial view may be 
viable once the opportunities for future action are taken into account. However, as 
soon as an option no longer promises to provide future value, it should be aban-
doned. Entrepreneurs sometimes allow unpromising ventures to drag on far too 
long, in part because teams can develop a collective belief that their venture will 
succeed, regardless of overwhelming skepticism and harsh realities [Carr, 2002].
18.3 Sources and Types of Capital
The four financial steps for building a successful firm appear in Figure 18.2. 
The initial funds used to launch a new firm are usually called seed capital. The 
first round of capital needs may be limited, and funds may be readily available 
from the founders, their families, and friends. Most technology firms, however,

investors. Finally, an initial public offering or an acquisition provides additional 
capital and a financial return to investors, founders, and other team members. 
Many sources of financial capital exist for a new business. See a list of sources 
in Table 18.3. There are two broad types of capital: equity and debt. Equity 
capital represents the investment in ownership through purchase of the stock 
of the firm. The holders of equity shares are called stockholders. Debt capital 
is money that a business has borrowed and must repay in a specified time with 
interest, as with a bank loan. Debt capital usually does not include any owner-
ship interest in the new firm. Usually, a new business can obtain debt capital 
only after some period in the marketplace and success evidenced by growing 
revenues and accounts receivable. In some cases, however, the government may 
help to secure or guarantee the loan, as with the Small Business Administration 
in the United States.
Equity financing of a venture at formation often begins with the funds pro-
vided by founders, friends, and family. Other equity investors and lenders, in 
fact, may expect the entrepreneur team to invest a significant amount of its own 
capital in the new business since doing so signals commitment and a firm belief 
in the possibility of success [Ogden et al., 2003]. A useful indicator of the qual-
ity of a new venture proposal for funding is the proportion of the entrepreneurs’ 
wealth that is committed to the new venture [Prasad et al., 2001]. 
Investments from family and friends are an excellent source of seed capital 
and can get a start-up far enough along to attract money from private inves-
tors or venture capital companies. For example, in 1995, Mike and Jackie Bezos 
invested $300,000 in their son Jeff’s start-up, Amazon.com. Today, those shares 
are worth many times what they paid for them. Family and friends are often 
willing to invest because of their relationships with one or more of the founders. 
However, family and friends should receive and review all the financing docu-
ments. Furthermore, they should be able to afford losing their investment and be 
comfortable with the risk.
Entrepreneurs also can approach professional investors who may make equity

invest in more than 50,000 firms annually in the United States. Venture  capitalists 
are  professional managers of investment funds. They invest in more than 5,000 
firms annually in the United States. The number of investments made by these two 
groups increases in good economic conditions. Angels and  venture  capitalists have 
invested about the same total amount in recent years.
Corporations also can invest directly in a venture. Sometimes, a corpora-
tion and a new venture establish a joint development agreement, which is aimed 
at developing a technology and which can provide capital to the new venture. 
Many technology corporations also have their own venture capital groups, which 
may invest directly in new ventures in exchange for partial ownership. Table 
18.4 details the pros and cons of several different sources of equity capital for the 
growth phase.
Eventually, an enterprise can seek financial capital through an initial public 
offering on the stock  market. Only the most qualified and experienced teams 
with an outstanding opportunity, however, are able to make an initial public 
offering in the early stages of building a business.

18.4 Bootstrapping and Crowdsourcing
Launching a start-up with modest funds from the entrepreneurial team, friends, 
and family is often called bootstrap financing. The term originated from the 
saying “they pulled themselves up by their bootstraps.” To bootstrap a ven-
ture means to start a firm by one’s own efforts. For many ventures with modest 
potential returns to investors, it is best to attract investors who are known to 
the entrepreneurs. Professional investors can only back a small fraction of the 
number of firms that start up each year. They seek to invest in large opportuni-
ties with high rates of return that have defensible competitive advantages, well-
defined business plans, and well-known, proven founders.
Bootstrap companies start small and build their experience and know-how 
as they go. Thus, bootstrap entrepreneurs often start with a modest business plan 
and a focused opportunity and look for a quick route to breakeven and positive 
bye23429_ch18_395-438.indd   404bye23429_ch18_395-438.indd   404 10/30/13   1:52 PM10/30/13   1:52 PM

cash flow. They also take steps to reduce costs and to improve cash flow, such 
as obtaining advance payments from customers; delaying payments to suppliers; 
and sharing employees, assets, or business space with other firms [Winborg and 
Landström, 2000].
Many businesses fit the model of a bootstrap opportunity. Although actual 
figures are difficult to obtain, up to 75 percent of start-ups are bootstrapped, 
self-financed firms. They keep costs low, seek out markets that competitors are 
ignoring, and build the business one step at a time. Entrepreneurs often must 
fund a significant portion of their new business since investors and lenders are 
reluctant to provide the required capital [Quadrini, 2001].
Eventually, these modest beginnings can turn into large successes as the 
firms find new opportunities. For example, Princeton Review was launched to 
compete with local private tutors of uneven quality. Eventually, the firm found 
its place on the national scene and competed with the Kaplan chain.
Pierre Omidyar launched AuctionWeb on Labor Day, 1995, while he 
was still employed full-time at a software firm. As an experienced software 
developer, Omidyar was intrigued by the opportunities to build a business on 
the Internet, and his vision was to provide a “perfect market” for buyers and 
sellers on an Internet auction site [Cohen, 2002]. He wrote the program for 
the site over the Labor Day weekend using his personal website provided by 
his home Internet service provider. The best domain name he could find was 
eBay.com. Throughout the fall of 1995, AuctionWeb had hosted thousands 
of auctions. By February 1996, Omidyar’s Internet service provider started 
charging him a commercial rate for his website, so he started charging a small 
fee for each sale. Starting in February, AuctionWeb was profitable. By April, 
AuctionWeb took in $5,000 in sales. In June, when revenues doubled to 
$10,000, Omidyar decided to quit his day job. He quickly attracted a friend, 
Jeff Skoll, to join him, first as a consultant and then full time by August 
1996. By late 1996, they moved out of Omidyar’s house to an office build-
ing in Campbell, California. By October 1996, AuctionWeb had a total of 
four employees when it hosted 28,000 auctions that month. AuctionWeb was 
dedicated to thriftiness and controlling costs. By January 1997, the site had 
hosted 200,000 auctions, and AuctionWeb was projecting revenues of over $4 
million for 1997. Early in 1997, Omidyar and Skoll wrote their first business 
plan and started looking for investors. By June 1997, Benchmark Capital, a 
venture capital firm, paid $5 million for 21.5 percent of the company, which 
then changed its name to eBay.
An advantage of bootstrap financing is the ability to make some mistakes 
and yet keep going. Many entrepreneurs underestimate the time and the market-
ing costs entailed in overcoming customer inertia and conservatism, especially 
with respect to new, unproven products. Entrepreneurs who are unsure of their 
markets or who do not have the experience to deal with investor pressure may be 
better off without other people’s capital, even if they can somehow get investors 
to overlook their limited credentials and experience.

CHAPTER 18   Sources of Capital406
Bootstrap companies usually follow five rules: (1) start small and probe the 
market, (2) learn from your customer and adjust the business model, (3) adjust 
the revenue and profit engine, (4) keep costs to a minimum, and (5) start expand-
ing the company, once the new venture starts growing, while keeping the cost 
curve below the revenue curve. Often, using bootstrap financing can instill long-
term frugality and financial discipline in a new venture. In fact, some research 
indicates that an overabundance of resources can harm a new venture [Hvide and 
Møen, 2010]. Thus, Guy Kawasaki tells entrepreneurs that they “should boot-
strap even if you have $10 million in the bank.” The advantages and disadvan-
tages of bootstrap financing are listed in Table 18.5. 
Increasingly, entrepreneurs also can use crowdfunding to obtain financing 
at an early stage. Crowdfunding refers to the joining together of a collection of 
individuals – the “crowd” – each of whom contributes a small amount to help 
fund a business. In exchange for their funding, these contributors may receive 
preferred treatment by the business, copies of products that a business creates, 
or, in some cases, a small amount of equity in the business.
Legal restrictions on ownership through crowdsourcing models vary by 
country. In the United States, the JOBS Act of 2012 provided an exemption for 
U.S. companies offering securities through an SEC-registered crowdfunding 
platform. Under the exemption, investors do not have to be accredited and they 
do not count toward the 2,000-investor threshold. Companies can sell up to $1 
million of securities in a 12-month period.
Tom Siebel earned an MBA and an MA in computer science from the Uni-
versity of Illinois. After graduation, he joined Oracle in 1982. By 1992, 
Siebel and Pat House had founded Siebel Systems. For the first 18 months, 
everyone worked for no salary but received equity shares. Siebel stated: 
“This was never about making money. It was never about going public; it 
was never about the creation of wealth. This was about an attempt to build 
an incredibly high-quality company.” [Malone, 2002]. Siebel Systems was 
purchased by Oracle for $6 billion in 2005.

18.5   Debt Financing and Grants 407
Crowdsourcing websites, such as AngelList and Kickstarter, serve as 
forums that bring together individual investors with businesses looking for 
funding. These websites are growing rapidly. AngelList, for example, grew 
from 1,500 companies in 2010 to 38,000 companies in 2012 [Bergl, 2013]. 
Kickstarter grew from $28 million pledged to projects in 2010 to $320 million 
pledged in 2012 [Popper, 2013].
18.5 Debt Financing and Grants
New ventures with sales and cash flow can consider recurring short-term or long-
term debt financing. Debt provides financial leverage to a firm and enables the 
firm to increase its return on equity. The principle of financial leverage works as 
long as a firm’s earnings are consistent and are larger than the interest charged 
for the borrowed money. Of course, if the firm’s net earnings should drop below 
the interest cost of borrowed money, the return on owners’ equity will decrease. 
Thus, most new ventures avoid financial leverage until they achieve stable 
growth.
Debt financing can be easier to arrange, and often cheaper, than equity for 
profitable companies. Any profitable firm can borrow money if it’s willing to 
pay high enough interest rates. Borrowers have the advantage of not giving up 
ownership or control of the firm—unless they cannot pay the interest. Also, the 
tax deduction for  interest paid cuts the effective cost of debt. Using debt, how-
ever, exposes a company to another kind of risk: If it does not show enough 
profit to cover debt payments, its existence may be in peril.
When underwriting a traditional loan, a lender first looks to a business’s 
cash flow. For new ventures with limited cash flow, obtaining a loan can thus 
be difficult. Sometimes, however, a new venture can secure a bank loan guar-
anteed by the Small Business Administration. Under the program, the federal 
agency does not actually make the loan—banks do, mostly—but it guarantees 
about 75 percent of the loaned amounts,  and it covers losses on the guaranteed 
portions from a combination of fees charged to banks and taxpayer funds. SBA 
loans in 2012 amounted to $21.9 billion to about 54,000 borrowers.
Asset-backed borrowing also may be available to new ventures. Ventures 
can borrow money using the liquid assets of the company, such as accounts 
receivable, or fixed assets, such as equipment or property, as collateral. An asset 
leaseback is another way to secure cash by giving up an asset such as a build-
ing or equipment. Of course, leasing equipment or property directly is a form of 
borrowing, too.
Finally, many new ventures arrange for a line of credit, which is a form of 
short-term  borrowing. The firm pays a fee for the right to access borrowed funds 
as needed. 
While debt financing must be paid back over time, some new ventures 
are eligible for grants, which require neither payback nor giving up equity in 
the venture. A number of grants are available to support very early-stage and

small-scale business efforts. The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) 
program is a U.S. government program, coordinated by the Small Business 
Administration, through which several government agencies make grants to 
small businesses. A “small business” is defined as an American-owned for-
profit business with fewer than 500 employees. A similar program, the Small 
Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, is focused on developing part-
nerships between small businesses and nonprofit U.S. research institutions such 
as universities. Together, SBIR and STTR grants to small businesses total $2 bil-
lion each year. Information about both programs can be obtained from the Small 
Business Administration (www.sba.gov). 
The National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA), also 
based in the United States, offers Advanced E-Team Grants to move products 
or technologies from the idea stage to prototype and to help collegiate innova-
tors secure intellectual property. Advanced E-Team Grants range in size from 
$1,000 to $20,000; the grant period is 12 to 18 months. More information can 
be obtained from NCIIA (www.nciia.org). Other examples in the United States 
include DARPA grants and various grants from state and local agencies.
As high-growth ventures often are based upon cutting-edge research, includ-
ing research conducted at universities, entrepreneurs also are wise to investigate 
research funding opportunities from national and regional government agencies 
and foundations. While these grants typically are intended to support research 
activities only, such funding can be critical for start-ups in areas such as energy, 
nanotechnology, and medicine, where the technical challenge is the primary risk 
faced by a new venture.
18.6 Angels
Angels are wealthy individuals, usually experienced entrepreneurs, who invest 
in business start-ups in exchange for equity in the new ventures. The term angel 
was originally used for a person who backed a new theater production on Broad-
way. Angels are people who share the vision of the new venture and provide 
support, advice, and money. In a sense, angels can provide wings for lifting a 
new creation. Angels often have personal experience and interest in the industry 
that the start-up is entering. 
Angel investing is a fast-growing segment of the new business financing 
industry, and it is often ideal for start-ups that have outgrown the capacity of 
investments from bootstrap financing but are still too small to attract the inter-
est of venture capital companies. For example, after raising the money to launch 
Amazon.com from family and friends, Jeff Bezos turned to angels, attracting $1.2 
million from a dozen angels. Angels funded about 66,000 U.S. ventures for a total 
of about $22.5 billion in 2011.
Angels often invest because they understand the industry and are attracted 
by the opportunity as well as the potential return. They may place less emphasis 
on an early return strategy and enjoy working with new entrepreneurs. Angels

18.6   Angels 409
serve as investors, advisers, and mentors for the new ventures they support. They 
may help new entrepreneurs create and refine a business model, find top talent, 
build business processes, test their ideas in the marketplace, and attract addi-
tional funding. Angels tend to invest close to home and limit their investments to 
early-stage companies. Most of the new ventures they fund are recommended to 
them by a business associate or an angel group. A summary list of typical char-
acteristics of angel investments is provided in Table 18.6.
Angels can be helpful investors, but sometimes they can be overbearing and 
have a negative impact. Choosing the right angel is important, so entrepreneurs 
should check references and capabilities of potential investors carefully. 
In some geographical regions, angels join together to form groups of 
angels. These groups work together to screen investment opportunities. For 
example, the Band of Angels meets monthly in Silicon Valley to hear a few 
presentations by start-ups (see www.bandangels.com). Angel groups are estab-
lished in many cities.
Incubators, such as Y-Combinator, can also function like angels in some 
ways. Y-Combinator provides seed money of $14,000, advice, and connec-
tions. In exchange, it takes an average stake of about 6 percent in a venture. 
Y- Combinator also arranges for each venture to receive a convertible note. A 
convertible note is a type of bond that the investor can convert to stock in the 
new venture or cash of equal value, at an agreed-upon price. A convertible note 
is a hybrid security with debt- and equity-like features. For the new venture, it 
has a lower rate than nonconvertible debt and thus reduces payment amounts. For 
the investor, the note offers the potential upside of conversion into equity while 
protecting the downside with cash flow from the payments.
In 1976, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs designed the Apple I computer in 
Jobs’s bedroom and built the prototype in Jobs’s house. To start the company, 
Jobs sold his Volkswagen and Wozniak sold his Hewlett-Packard calculator, 
which raised $1,300. With that capital and credit from local electronics suppli-
ers, they set up their first production line. Jobs met Mike Markkula, a former 
marketing manager at Intel and wealthy angel who invested $91,000 in cash and 
personally guaranteed a bank line of credit for $250,000. Jobs, Wozniak, and 
Markkula each held one-third ownership of Apple Computer [Young, 1988]. 
Markkula, the angel investor, became chairman of the company in 1977.

CHAPTER 18   Sources of Capital410
The founders of Google, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, approached Sun 
Microsystems cofounder Andy Bechtolsheim in 1998, who wrote a $100,000 
check after a 15-minute pitch describing the new business. By 1999, the ven-
ture capital firms of Kleiner Perkins, Caufield and Byers, and Sequoia also 
invested.
18.7 Venture Capital
Venture capital is a source of funds for new ventures that is managed by invest-
ment professionals on behalf of the investors in the venture capital fund. The 
people who manage the venture capital fund are called venture capitalists. These 
funds typically invest in new ventures with high potential returns. The private 
venture capital firm is seeking equity participation in these high-potential firms. 
Each year in the United States, over 5,000 new ventures receive  funding from 
venture capital. The venture capital firm engages in careful screening and due 
diligence before investing. It brings in other venture capital investors in a financ-
ing round and prepares contracts and restrictions (called term sheets) with the 
new venture. Venture capital firms are usually interested in technology ventures 
with high potential.
A typical venture capital firm will have enough investments so as to diver-
sify its portfolio. Each venture capital firm will have several partners who are 
experienced, full-time investors. Their knowledge of finance and technology 
enables them to judge the potential investment. Normally, venture capital invest-
ing is staged financing. Thus, new information and risk reduction at each stage 
enables the venture capitalist to make better decisions. The new ventures are held 
to staged goals, milestones, and deadlines for achieving these milestones. A typi-
cal investment from a venture capital firm is $1 million to $5 million in the first 
financing round, with a total commitment of $10 million to $20 million. Over 
several stages with several venture funds involved, the combined funding potential 
can be $50 to $100 million. 
Many entrepreneurs start up a new business to gain independence, only to 
find that they have a new set of partners—the venture capitalists acting as mem-
bers of the board of directors. Most venture capitalists look for ventures that can 
become profitable and attain at least $100 million a year in revenues in the next 
five or six years. Entrepreneurs that envision high-growth ventures will likely 
turn to venture capitalists [Florin, 2005].
A venture capital portfolio of 20 to 30 new ventures may achieve an overall 
annual return of 30 percent. Perhaps one-half of the new ventures fail or provide 
a low return. Fortunately, two or three new ventures may provide an overall 
annual return of 50 to 100 percent. Therefore, venture capital firms are looking 
for new ventures that potentially can return at least 50 percent annually. Obvi-
ously, these candidates must be firms with high-potential growth.
The four investment requirements used by the venture capitalists in the 
selection process are (1) the industry is well-known to them; (2) the amount of 
bye23429_ch18_395-438.indd   410bye23429_ch18_395-438.indd   410 10/30/13   1:52 PM10/30/13   1:52 PM

the investment is greater than $1 million; (3) the company is at the  appropriate 
stage of progress; and (4) the potential return is 40 percent or more annu-
ally. The track record of the team is also critically reviewed [Gompers and 
 Sahlman, 2002].
Venture capitalists prefer staged or phased financing. The four stages are 
shown in Table 18.7. Venture capital is normally available in the development 
and growth stages, with greatest emphasis on the development stage. Venture 
capital money is limited-term money [Zider, 1998]. Typically, a venture capital 
firm wants to harvest (realize) its return on investment within five to 10 years. 
The harvest is usually facilitated through an initial public offering in the public 
equity markets or an acquisition by an established company.
TABLE 18.7 Investment stages.
 1. Seed or start-up stage: Complete the team, formalize the plan, complete initial arrange-
ments. Financial capital from angels, friends, and family.
 2. Development stage (series A): Product development and prototype, ready for launch. 
Financial capital from venture capital funds.
 3. Growth stage (series B or C, and others as required): Launch and growth phase. Financial 
capital from venture capital firms and corporations.
 4. Competitive or maturity stage (initial public offering): Mature firm in a competitive con-
text. Financial capital from offerings in the public equity markets.
New enterprises that can become large businesses may require larger capital 
investments as these companies grow.  Workday raised $250 million from 
venture capitalists and more than $600 million from its 2012 IPO.  Amazon, 
by contrast, raised $8 million from venture capitalists and $54 million from 
its 1997 IPO.  Amazon, unlike Workday, has chosen to use debt to fund 
growth, including raising a $1.25 billion debt offering in 1999.
Workday and Amazon: Raising Capital Multiple Ways
Venture capitalists expect the new business to achieve certain outcomes, 
often called milestones, at the end of a funding stage before proceeding to the 
next stage. Examples of the milestones for each stage are shown in Table 18.8. 
Each milestone functions as a miniplan about each stage for the venture. For 
example, a milestone may state that a working prototype will be available in six 
months. Entrepreneurs should therefore develop a series of milestones and then 
tie their fundraising activities to the completion of them [Berkery, 2008]. 
A special type of venture capital is available for social benefit firms or those 
that promise to create products that lead to sustainable resources or environments. 
For example, the Silicon Valley Social Venture Fund, known as SV2, is dedicated 
to funding organizations in the San Francisco Bay area that facilitate social change

(www.sv2.org). The Omidyar Network provides funding to for-profit ventures 
that attempt to make a positive impact on society (www.omidyar.net).
Venture capital funds concentrate on attractive, disruptive, and high-growth 
industries. They concentrated on computers and biotechnology in the 1980s 
and communications and the Internet in the 1990s. Areas of concentration in 
the 2000s included biomedical devices, genomics, energy, and mobile com-
puting. In the 2010s, the focus includes mobile, enterprise software, big data, 
networking,  and medical devices. By investing in emerging industries, venture 
 capitalists hope to build great companies in important industries while reaping 
large rewards.
Venture capitalists carry out one or more of five functions: (1) they pro-
vide  capital for start-ups, (2) they evaluate projects for other participants in 
the venture, (3) they provide expertise for the development of the firm, (4) they 
serve as the central coordinator for all the participants involved during a firm’s 
infancy, and (5) they provide introductions to potential customers, employees, 
collaborators, and future financiers. The importance of these nonfinancial con-
tributions cannot be overstated [Bertoni et al., 2011]. Venture-capital-backed 
firms demonstrate more responsive product development, greater collaborative 
activity, and more agile management decision making [Hsu, 2006; Arthurs and 
Busenitz, 2006].
In a typical deal at the development stage, a group of two or three venture 
capitalists will invest $5 million to $15 million in exchange for 40 percent to 60 
percent preferred-equity ownership. The preferred class of stock provides the 
venture capitalists with preference over common stock held by founders, fam-
ily, friends, and other first-stage investors. They will hold a liquidation prefer-
ence on rights to assets. Furthermore, venture capitalists seek voting rights over 
key decisions such as the sale of the firm or the timing of an IPO. They usually 
require seats on the board of directors.
Venture capital is high-risk and high-return capital available to high-potential 
firms. Venture capitalists plan for a 50 percent or more annualized return on 
their investment with built-in protections and controls over the new venture. 
The structure of most venture capital contractual agreements (deals) favors the 
venture capitalist and may place the entrepreneur at a disadvantage if plans do 
not work out. However, the venture capital firms bring sizable money, industry 
knowledge and contacts for recruiting and customer assistance, and a pathway 
to a public stock offering [Fitza et al., 2009]. The risk-and-reward profiles for

various types of investments are shown in Figure 18.4. Venture capitalists work 
at the high risk–high return end of the profile.
Venture capital investments in the United States in new emerging ventures 
averaged $25 billion per year over the decade of the 1990s and peaked at $106 
billion in 2000 during the dot.com and telecommunications boom. Worldwide 
venture capital investments in technology ventures are shown in Table 18.9 for 
2003 to 2012 along with IPOs.
Venture capitalists get good rates of return by buying shares of private com-
panies early and then helping management use that cash to turn the start-ups into 
businesses with growing revenues, profitability, and cash flow. The big winners 
generally have to earn 10 times the original investment money in four to five 
years. A multiple of 10 times is equivalent to a 58.5 percent annual return over 
the five years. If a venture capitalist invests $5 million in the early stage of a 
company, his or her ownership stake is hoped to be worth $50 million in five 
years. If the venture capitalist owns one-half of the  company, the firm must be 
worth $100 million after five years for that return.

The characteristics of a good venture capital deal from the venture capital-
ists’ view and the venture founders’ view appear in Table 18.10. A large oppor-
tunity in a fast-growing industry led by a very competent, experienced team 
is attractive to venture capitalists. With a good venture capitalist partner, the 
founders of the new venture can realize their dream of a well-capitalized venture 
that can make a big difference in their industry. At the same time, the found-
ing team must recognize that venture  capital has a high cost of potential loss of 
ownership, control, and even changing the vision of the venture. A list of U.S. 
venture capital firms is available from the National Venture Capital Association 
(www.nvca.org). 
New and emerging businesses can use the five steps outlined in Table 18.11 
to secure venture capital. Every one of these steps takes time, and the whole

■ Market risk—deliver extraordinary customer experiences
4. Agree on valuation and ownership structure.
5. Agree on a contract (term sheet) describing the deal and its terms.
process may take 3 to 12 months. Given the extent of technology markets, there 
is no scarcity of good ideas. What is scarce is experienced, competent, and com-
mitted entrepreneurs. Investors strive to find the best entrepreneurial teams to 
invest in. 
Fred Smith used his family money to found Federal Express (FedEx) in 
1973. He leased several planes and built a 25-city network. He knew addi-
tional funding would depend on a solid start, so he tested the system for 
two weeks, shipping empty packages cross-country. In mid-April 1973, he 
opened for business. To expand his network, Smith turned to venture capi-
talists. He got his venture capital because he reduced the perceived risk with 
his own money in FedEx. By 1975, FedEx was profitable. FedEx sold stock 
to the public with an IPO in 1978.

18.8 Corporate Venture Capital
Large companies such as Intel, Microsoft, and Cisco Systems also invest in 
external start-ups [Chesbrough, 2002]. Corporate venture  capital is the invest-
ment of corporate funds in start-up firms that are not part of the corporation. In 
this case, established corporations are acting as venture capitalists. Corporations 
can have different goals for their venture capital programs [Gaba and Meyer, 
2008]. In some cases, the corporate venture capitalist is looking for new ventures 
that can offer synergies between itself and the new venture. Another approach 
is for the corporate venture capitalist to make an investment to use its industry 
knowledge and then generate a high return on investment. Corporate investors 
often use external venturing programs as a mechanism for identifying and moni-
toring promising acquisition targets, too.
An example of a strategic investment is one of many made by Microsoft in 
start-up companies that could help advance its Internet businesses. Other firms

make corporate venture capital investments in firms that will drive and expand 
the markets for the investors’ own products. For example, Intel has invested 
in over 1,100 companies for a total of $7.9 billion, with the goal of nurturing 
technologies that could stimulate demand for Intel’s chip business. Another 
possible corporate investment strategy is to support start-ups that may be valu-
able to the corporation’s future operations, as with investments by Applied 
Materials and TEL into semiconductor materials ventures. A summary of the 
four forms of corporate venture capital investments is in Figure 18.5.
Many start-ups can benefit from corporate venture capital, since corporations 
can make good partners and the cost of the capital can be less than that from regular 
venture capitalists. Moreover, corporate venture capital may increase the credibility 
of the new venture and may not exert as much control as regular venture capitalists. 
Perhaps the most important benefit of corporate venture capital is the potential for 
a strong partnership between the corporate venture  capitalists and the new venture 
that strategically couples the strength of the large corporation with the innovation 
of the start-up [Mason and Rohner, 2002]. Corporate venture capital is especially 
beneficial to a new venture when it requires specialized complementary assets or 
operates in a highly uncertain environment [Park and Steensma, 2012].
At the same time, entrepreneurs need to be cautious. Corporate venture capi-
talists often invest to be aware of potential competitors and their interests may 
not be aligned with those of the start-up. Moreover, corporate venture capitalists 
can take longer to close a deal and may ask for distribution rights. They can also 
stymie a new venture’s attempts to partner with a competitor to the corporation 
and may limit exit opportunities.

18.9   Valuation 417
18.9 Valuation
The valuation rule is the algorithm by which an investor such as an angel or 
venture capitalist assigns a monetary value to a new venture. For many oper-
ating businesses, determining the net present value (NPV) is the best method 
for selecting alternative projects. A new enterprise, however, has uncertain pro 
forma cash flows, and investors find it difficult to use projected cash flows as 
reliable measures. Even if potential cash flows can be estimated, how does an 
investor decide what is a fair price for a share of ownership in a new firm?
Theoretically, the value of a company is equal to the present value of all 
dividends or cash disbursements paid now or later. A new firm has no historical 
results to use to project future cash flows. Furthermore, fads and social dynam-
ics play a role in the determination of the value of a firm. Thus, determining the 
value of a start-up is difficult.
Discounted cash flow is a method of calculating the present value of a 
future stream of cash flow based on discounting back future flows at the end 
of a number of years using a discount rate (r) (see equation 18.1). Let us start 
with the discounted cash flow rules for the valuation of a new venture, ABC 
Inc., with projected cash flows as shown in Table 18.12. Since the firm is not 
yet operating, these projections are subject to wide uncertainty. With a potential 
investment in the first year, what percentage of the firm’s  ownership should the 
investor require? What is the discount rate for this  calculation?
The discount rate is the rate (r) at which future earnings or cash flow is dis-
counted because of the time value of money. The discount rate (r) for a firm is its 
cost of capital. Therefore, the discount rate for investors will be their expected 
return on investment. Thus, the new enterprise may propose using a discount rate 
of 15 percent, while the investors may demand a return of 30 percent or more. 
McNulty and colleagues [2002] have shown the real cost of capital of a biotech 
start-up is about 35 percent. Also, for the cash flow calculation, we need to have 
an estimate of the cash flow for year 6 and later. However, it is unreasonable to 
project into year 6 and later since the estimates become less reliable for later years. 
Thus, investors will be reluctant to use the discounted cash flow method for valua-
tion of a firm that is yet to provide any reliable cash flow.
Venture capitalists or angels will want a harvest of the value of the firm by an 
IPO, acquisition, or buyout of their share of ownership by year 5 to 10. Realisti-
cally, the IPO or acquisition may not happen until year 6 or later. Examining the

projections for ABC Inc. shown in Table 18.12, a valuation can be determined for 
year 5 using a method favored by venture capitalists and angels.
The new venture valuation rule uses the projected sales, profit, and cash 
flow in a target year (N) and the projected earning growth rate (g) for five years 
after year N. The investment by the investor (I) is made at the beginning of year 
1. The investor requires an annual return (gain) on investment of G for N years. 
Thus, investors expect a capital return after N years of (1 1 G)
N times their 
original investment I. Therefore,
CR 5 (1 1 G)N 3 I
 5 M 3 I (18.2)
where CR is the capital return and M is the multiple of the investment. Thus, if 
an investor invests $1.1 million in the series A stage and the expected annual 
return on investment, G, is 45 percent over a five-year period, then
M 5 (1 1 0.45)
5 5 6.41
Therefore,
CR 5 M 3 I 5 6.41 3 1.1 5 7.05
The percentage ownership (PO) demanded by the investor will then be
PO 5   CR ____ 
MV   3 100%
where MV is the expected market value of the new venture in year N.
To calculate the expected market value in year 5, we may use the price-to-
earnings or PE ratio of comparative firms to estimate the market value in year 
N. Then,
 MV 5 PE 3 EN (18.3)
where EN is the earnings in year N. In this case for year 5, EN 5 $1,000,000 
(Table 18.12). The comparative PE ratio is obtained by looking at the industry 
PE ratios while accounting for the expected growth rate of earnings over the 
ensuing years. In this case, we might expect a growth rate of earnings of 20 per-
cent for several years following year 5. Then, examining the industry data, we 
estimate the appropriate PE ratio is 16. Therefore, we have
MV 5 16 3 $1,000,000
5 $16,000,000
Then the required percentage ownership is
 PO 5   CR

MV   3 100%

18.9   Valuation 419
The market value can also be calculated using a price-to-sales ratio (PS) for 
comparative firms. If comparative firms have a PS 5 2.3, then the market value 
would be MV 5 PS 3 S. The market value for ABC Inc. is
MV 5 PS 3 S
5 2.3 3 $8,000,000 5 $18,400,000
Then the percentage ownership required by the investor would be
PO 5   CR ____ 
MV   3 100% 5   7.05 _____ 
18.40   3 100% 5 38.3%
Using these calculations, the investor may reasonably expect to receive 40 to 50 
percent of the firm’s ownership in a series A investment. Given the uncertain 
nature of the sales and profit projections, the valuation of a firm is a function of the 
potential of the firm to achieve a big success in a short time. This simple example 
assumes no more stages of investment are required in the five-year period.
Netscape was formed by Marc Andreesen, coauthor of the University of Illi-
nois Mosiac Web browser, and Jim Clark, founder and former CEO of Sili con 
Graphics. As an angel investor, Clark invested $3 million in Netscape in May 1994. 
Clark, a respected entrepreneur, then offered a $6.4 million investment opportunity 
(at $2.25 per share) for 15 percent of the firm to Kleiner Perkins, a premier venture 
capital firm. Netscape’s sales rocketed to $16 million in the first six months of 
operations [Lewis, 2000]. Just before the IPO, Clark owned 30.0 percent of the firm 
and Andreesen owned 12.3 percent. The multiple (M) they achieved in 17 months 
on their seed shares was 37.3. Kleiner Perkins achieved a multiple of 12.4 on its 
first-stage investment in just 13 months. Netscape was the first high-profile venture 
of the Internet boom companies and reaped large rewards. A summary of the valu-
ation of Netscape (price per share) is shown in Table 18.13.
When a firm makes an offering, it raises an investment (INV). The firm 
hopes to set its pre-money (before the investment) value as PREMV. Then

Consider a firm, EZY Inc., with a series of investments as shown in Table 18.14. 
A set of venture capital investors invests in the firm in the series A round at 90 cents 
per share and owns 40.0 percent of the firm after the purchase. At the next stage, 
series B, the firm has missed its milestones, and the investors offer a reduced share 
price of 50 cents per share. This round (or stage) of financing is called a down round, 
since the price per share goes down. As a result, the venture capitalists receive a sig-
nificant increase in their ownership in the firm. If the firm meets or exceeds its mile-
stones, subsequent rounds can be “up priced.” Also, entrepreneurs are urged to seek 
new investment rounds from other investors to check market pricing conditions.
LinkedIn’s experience through its various stages of venture capital invest-
ments is shown in Table 18.15.
The timing of staged investments is a critical issue for the CEO and CFO 
of a new company that has not yet achieved breakeven. This company is using 
cash from an earlier investment to cover its negative cash flow. We define 
burn rate as cash in minus cash out, on a monthly basis. Thus, if a firm has 
$800,000 cash in the bank and has a burn rate of $100,000 per month, it will 
run out of cash in eight months unless it can reduce its burn rate.

18.10   Initial Public Offering 421
Some companies spend money unwisely, so a good rule is to keep the burn 
rate as low as possible. The alternative is to raise new rounds of new  financing, 
if that is possible, to avoid dilution.

 ■ Sales greater than $100 million
 ■ Profit margins greater than 14 percent
 ■ Return on capital greater than 14 percent
A big opportunity often leads to success, but not always. Founded by Peter 
Adderton in 2005, Amp’d Mobile was a Mobile Virtual Network Opera-
tor (MVNO) located in Los Angeles, California. As a mobile phone service 
provider targeting youth and young professionals, it sought to use emerging 
technologies like 3G wireless internet to provide phones capable of delivering 
media content and advanced social networking capabilities. In 2007, Amp’d 
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It had spent all $360 million it had acquired 
over five rounds of funding. The company had acquired only 175,000 sub-
scribers, which did not produce enough revenue to cover its operating costs. 
Some worried that Amp’d did not perform proper credit checks on subscrib-
ers, perhaps contributing to its large percentage of nonpayers. 
Amp’d Mobile’s Bankruptcy
18.10 Initial Public Offering
The first public equity issue of stock made by a company is referred to as an 
 initial public offering (IPO). The newly issued stock is sold to all interested 
investors of the general public in a cash offer. In the United States, the IPO 
is a sale of a portion of the company to the public by filing with the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission (SEC) and listing its stock on one of the stock 
exchanges. The offer is managed via a financial intermediary, an investment 
bank, which aids in the sale of the securities. The investment bank performs 
such services as formulating the method of issuance, pricing, and selling the new 
securities. Conditions that favor an IPO are shown in Table 18.16.
The new venture firm has three possible reasons to issue an IPO: (1) raise 
new capital, (2) liquidity, and (3) image or brand. Many fast-growing firms will 
need large capital infusions of more than $30 million, and the public market is 
suitable for these larger amounts. Second, liquidity—the ability to easily convert 
ownership to cash—is facilitated by the IPO. The third reason is to help build 
brand reputation by allowing public ownership of the new venture firm. These 
advantages of issuing an IPO are summarized in Table 18.17.
The disadvantages of issuing an IPO include: (1) offering costs, (2) dis-
closure and scrutiny, and (3) perceived short-term pressures. Table 18.17 lists

18.10   Initial Public Offering 423
Determining the appropriate offering price is the most important thing the 
lead investment bank must do for an initial public offering. The issuing firm 
faces a potential cost if the offering price is set too high or too low. If the issue 
is priced too high, it may be unsuccessful and be withdrawn. If the issue is 
priced below the true market price, the issuer’s existing shareholders will expe-
rience an opportunity loss.
The IPO marketing process includes a road show. Road shows involve the 
lead underwriters and key firm managers marketing the firm to prospective 
investors (institutional investors) via presentations in major cities and one-on-
one meetings with mutual fund managers.
During the late 1990s, Silicon Valley became known for IPOs that “popped.” 
High demand resulted in shares that were so sought after on the first day of 
public sale, the share price closed at much higher values than at the open-
ing trades. In 1995, this was an uncommon occurrence. In August of that 
year, a start-up called Netscape went public at the young corporate age of 
16 months. Demand for the shares was so high that  trading was delayed for 
over two hours as a clearing price was sought. On that day, the stock even-
tually rose to nearly three times its initial price, closing at nearly double its 
initial offering price. Netscape had raised $140 million in its IPO, but its 
impact was even larger. Netscape is credited with making the Internet acces-
sible to mainstream users around the world. By launching the hottest IPO 
market in history, it stimulated the appetite of investors for technology IPOs 
for several years. Google had a similar effect with its IPO in 2004.
The IPO That Ignited the Dot Com Boom
onerous to a small, emerging firm. Moreover, the disclosure and scrutiny can 
be burdensome and any misstep can cause havoc with the company’s share 
price. Furthermore, many new firms find the pressure for reports of quarterly 
earnings improvements difficult to satisfy. Finally, firms with a market value 
of less than $300 million are often thinly traded and illiquid. Table 18.19 lists 
the conditions that favor an IPO.
The process for an IPO is in Table 18.18. The timing of the IPO is criti-
cal since the IPO market can be very volatile. The IPO market was favorable 
in the periods 1998 to 2000 and 2006 to 2007, and very unfavorable in the 
periods 2001 to 2003 and 2008 to 2009. See Table 18.9 for IPO data for 2003 
to 2012.

CHAPTER 18   Sources of Capital424
Amazon.com was founded in July 1994 and opened for business in July 
1995. It reached sales of $16 million for the quarter ending March 31, 1997, 
but was operating at a loss. Jeff Bezos hoped to take the company public to 
raise additional funds and to build public recognition for it. The total invest-
ment from Bezos, angels, and Kleiner Perkins amounted to approximately 
$9 million. Amazon selected Deutsche Morgan Grenfell (DMG) as its invest-
ment bankers in February 1997 and began the process of preparing the neces-
sary documents for submission to the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC). Amazon went public with an IPO selling three million shares at a price 
of $18 each. Its revenue per share, pre-IPO, was approximately $1.80. Thus, 
the firm went public at a price-to-sales ratio of 10. The firm increased its sales 
from $148 million in 1997 to $1.5 billion in 2002, but was unprofitable in 
those years.
If a firm intends to eventually issue an IPO when the market is favorable, it 
is wise to work from the beginning to be in position to qualify its IPO. Thus, a 
firm planning to go public needs to meet all the regulatory requirements in place 
when creating the prospectus. This means having audited financial statements, a 
complete management team, a sustainable competitive advantage, and an inde-
pendent board of directors. Some firms also engage in “prestige enhancement” 
leading up to an IPO, hiring prestigious executives and directors with the hope 
that doing so will raise the share price [Chen et al., 2008].
The prospectus or selling document is a part of the information provided to 
the SEC for approval. The information in the prospectus must be presented in 
an organized, logical sequence and an easy-to-read, understandable manner to 
obtain SEC approval. Some of the most common sections of a prospectus are: 
prospectus summary, description of the company and its business, risk factors, 
use of proceeds, dividend policy, capitalization, dilution, management, owners, 
and the financial statements.
The cover page of the prospectus for LinkedIn’s IPO in 2011 is shown in 
Figure 18.6a. The table of contents for the LinkedIn prospectus is shown in 
 Figure 18.6b. The summary page, the offering page, and the summary financial 
data are provided in Figures 18.6c, d, and e, respectively. LinkedIn raised $352.8 
million from the offering of 7.8 million shares.

PROSPECTUS SUMMARY
The following summary highlights information contained elsewhere in this prospectus and does not contain all 
of the information that you should consider in making your investment decision. Before investing in our Class A 
common stock, you should carefully read this entire prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements 
and the related notes included in this prospectus and the information set forth under the headings “Risk Fac-
tors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
LINKEDIN CORPORATION
We are the world’s largest professional network on the Internet with more than 100 million members in over 200 
countries and territories. Through our proprietary platform, members are able to create, manage and share their 
professional identity online, build and engage with their professional network, access shared knowledge and 
insights, and find business opportunities, enabling them to be more productive and successful.
We believe we are the most extensive, accurate and accessible network focused on professionals. We believe 
we are creating significant value for professionals, enterprises and professional organizations worldwide by con-
necting talent with opportunity at massive scale. We believe that our members and the enterprises and profes-
sional organizations that use our platform are only beginning to leverage the power and potential of our network 
and its underlying database of professional information.
Our comprehensive platform provides members with solutions, including applications and tools, to search, 
connect and communicate with business contacts, learn about attractive career opportunities, join industry 
groups, research organizations and share information. At the core of our platform are our members, who cre-
ate profiles that serve as their professional profiles and are accessible by any other member, as well as (unless 
a member chooses otherwise) anyone with an Internet connection. We believe that our platform allows our 
members to compete more effectively, make better decisions faster and manage their careers to achieve their full 
potential.
The cornerstone of our business strategy is to focus on our members first. We provide the majority of our 
solutions to our members at no cost. We believe this approach provides the best way to continue to build a criti-
cal mass of members, resulting in beneficial network effects that promote greater utilization of our solutions, 
higher levels of engagement and increased value for all of our members.
We provide enterprises and professional organizations of all sizes with solutions designed to identify spe-
cific talent within our global network, enable their employees to be more productive and successful, build brand 
awareness, and market their products and services. Enterprises and professional organizations that use our 
solutions include large corporations, small- and medium-sized businesses, educational institutions, government 
agencies, nonprofit organizations and other similar entities. Our current products for enterprises and professional 
organizations include hiring solutions, marketing solutions and premium subscriptions. Our hiring solutions are 
transforming the talent acquisition market by providing unique access not only to active job seekers but also 
to passive candidates who are not actively looking to change jobs. Our marketing solutions enable enterprises 
to reach a large audience of influential and affluent professionals and connect them to relevant products and 
services.
We generate revenue from enterprises and professional organizations by selling our hiring solutions and mar-
keting solutions offline through our field sales organization or online on our website. We also generate revenue 
from members, acting as individuals or on behalf of their enterprise or professional organization, who subscribe 
to our premium services. We strive to ensure that our hiring solutions, marketing solutions and premium subscrip-
tions provide both a high level of value for our customers and also a high degree of relevance for our members.

We believe this monetization strategy properly aligns objectives among members, customers and our entire net-
work and supports our financial objective of sustainable revenue and earnings growth over the long term.
We have achieved significant growth as our network has scaled and as we have expanded our product offer-
ings. From 2009 to 2010, net revenue increased $123.0 million, or 102%, net income increased $19.4 million, 
or 487%, and adjusted EBITDA increased $33.3 million, or 227%. In the three months ended March 31, 2011, 
net revenue increased $49.2 million, or 110%, net income increased $0.3 million, or 14%, and adjusted EBITDA 
increased $4.2 million, or 46%, over the three months ended March 31, 2010. See “Adjusted EBITDA” below 
for a definition of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss).
Our Mission
Our mission is to connect the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful. Our mem-
bers come first. We believe that prioritizing the needs of our members is the most effective, and ultimately the 
most profitable, way to accomplish our mission and to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. We 
will continue to concentrate on opportunities we believe are in the best interests of our members. Our long-term 
approach enables us to invest, innovate and pioneer in unexplored segments of our industry to increase the value 
proposition of our proprietary platform and extensive data.
Our solutions are designed to enable professionals to achieve higher levels of performance and professional 
success and enable enterprises and professional organizations to find and connect with the world’s best talent.
Our Vision
Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every professional in the world. This vision not only applies to 
each of our employees, but every LinkedIn member, each of whom has the ability to create economic opportuni-
ties for others. We believe this is the fundamental power of our network.
Our Opportunity
We believe we are transforming the way people work by connecting talent with opportunity at massive scale. 
Our goal is to provide a global platform capable of mapping every professional’s experience, skills and other 
relevant professional data to his or her professional graph, including connections with colleagues and business 
contacts.
We provide the following key benefits to our members:
•  Ability to Manage Their Professional Identity. Through online professional profiles of record that mem-
bers create, manage and control, we are reshaping how members present their professional identity. Our 
members share, at their own discretion, information about themselves in their profiles, and this data is 
available, accessible and searchable online. The accuracy of our members’ public profile information 
combined with our search engine optimization technology often enables their professional profiles to 
appear at or near the top of search engine results, increasing the awareness of our members’ professional 
identities.
•  Enhanced Ability to Build and Engage with Their Professional Network. We enable members to build 
their professional networks by linking their professional profiles with those of others to whom they are 
directly and indirectly connected, creating an ever-expanding professional graph. In this manner, mem-
bers use our platform to engage with other members whom they trust and value and reach people who are 
not known to them but who are known and trusted by others within their professional network. Through 
access to rich, up-to-date profile and professional graph data, members can make better use of their exist-
ing and new connections.

•  Access to Knowledge, Insights and Opportunities. We believe we are a trusted source for comprehensive 
and rich, real-time news, opinions and other professional intelligence. Our proprietary platform provides 
solutions that enable our members to search and access insights and opportunities generated by our com-
munity of professionals, enterprises and professional organizations. The information and opportunities 
presented to each member are personalized based on his or her profile and professional graph, thereby 
providing our members with compelling and relevant information designed to make them more produc-
tive and successful.
In addition, enterprises and professional organizations also utilize our solutions to receive numerous benefits, 
such as attracting new talent and more fully understanding, retaining and engaging with their employees and 
other professionals. We provide the following key benefits to enterprises and professional organizations:
•  Matching Talent with Opportunity. With the world’s largest online professional network, we provide 
enterprises and professional organizations the ability to connect with the global professional talent pool 
at scale. Our extensive hiring solutions allow enterprises and professional organizations to leverage the 
insights from our platform to source and develop a pipeline of active and passive talent, including the 
ability to automate talent matching, post jobs, engage and educate candidates, streamline applications and 
validate information. We believe our solutions are both more cost-effective and more efficient than tradi-
tional recruiting approaches, such as hiring third-party search firms, to identify and screen candidates.
•  Efficient Marketing Channel. Through our marketing solutions, enterprises and professional organiza-
tions are able to create, promote and control their corporate identity and enhance their brand awareness. 
Our marketing solutions, including our self-service platform, allow enterprises and professional organiza-
tions to pursue business-to-business marketing, prosumer marketing and marketing to mass consumers. 
Marketers use our solutions to create an online brand and corporate identity, disseminate trade publica-
tions and collateral, engage in highly targeted marketing campaigns and gain rich customer insights, all at 
scale and on a cost-effective basis, which is particularly attractive to small- and medium-sized enterprises 
and professional organizations that have limited resources. Our proprietary platform is designed to lever-
age viral actions, social media, trusted recommendations and our rich user-generated data to efficiently 
connect members, enterprises and professional organizations to relevant products and services.
•  Targeted Advertising. Our member base constitutes one of the most influential, affluent and highly edu-
cated audiences on the web. According to The Nielsen Company @Plan data released in December 2010, 
U.S. visitors to our website represent more decision makers, have higher average household incomes and 
are comprised of more college or post graduates than U.S. visitors of many leading business websites. Our 
marketing solutions provide advertisers with the ability to target audiences based on our members’ profile 
information, including title, function, company name, company size, industry and geography. In addition, 
our detailed advertising campaign reports provide advertisers with insights to further maximize the return 
on their advertising budget.
•  Increase Employee Productivity. We serve as the central hub of a professional’s online network and a 
platform for enterprises and professional organizations to share knowledge and professional insights with 
their employees and thereby increase their productivity. For example, employees who are members are 
able to join groups for sharing information, articles, links, conversations and opinions. In addition, sales 
professionals who are members are able to accelerate their sales processes by accessing information to 
identify leads and decisionmakers, request introductions to other members through a common connection 
and thereby increase their efficiency and potentially eliminate cold calls altogether.

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following strengths provide us competitive advantages in realizing the potential of our opportunity:
•  Exclusive Focus on Professionals. As a result of our exclusive focus on professionals, we have built the 
world’s largest professional network on the Internet with over 100 million members. We have developed 
a strong brand as a trusted database for profile information and provider of applications and tools for 
professionals to more effectively present their professional identity online, build and engage with their 
professional network more efficiently, and access insights to be more productive and successful.
•  Large and Growing Global Member Base. Our member base continues to grow rapidly, adding approxi-
mately one new member every second, primarily through “word-of-mouth” and the network effects of our 
platform. While it took us nearly 500 days to reach our first one million members, during the second half 
of 2010, on average, we added more than a million new members every 10 days. Between 2008 and 2010, 
our member base increased at a 76% compounded annual growth rate. As of January 2011, over 50% of 
our members were from outside of the United States and our member base included executives from all of 
the companies in the 2010 Fortune 500.
•  Business Model with Powerful Network Effects. The size and growth of our member base, the number of 
enterprises and professional organizations that use our platform, and the amount of rich and accurate infor-
mation generated by our members increase the value we deliver to all participants in our network. A larger 
member base provides more opportunities to form professional connections for members, as well as increased 
opportunities to identify and attract talent for enterprises and professional organizations. At the same time, an 
increasing number of enterprises and professional organizations accessing our network enhances the relevance 
for members who stand to benefit from professional insights and opportunities. We believe the breadth and 
depth of our network would be difficult to replicate and represents a significant competitive advantage.
•  Robust and Trusted Source of Relevant Professional Data. Our proprietary platform processes, filters 
and indexes a vast and growing amount of user-generated content, including updates to members’ profes-
sional profiles, connections, activities and recommendations. The more data our members choose to share, 
the more value they receive from the network. As a result, members are more willing to share accurate 
and detailed information about themselves. We use the information that flows through our platform to 
provide more relevant searches and information to enhance productivity. Since our formation, we have 
provided easy-to-use controls that enable our members to select what they would like to share with whom, 
and we believe we have been clear and consistent on how we use this information to the benefit of mem-
bers, enterprises and professional organizations.
•  Large Customer Base. Thousands of enterprises and professional organizations use our hiring solutions 
and marketing solutions. In 2010, our hiring solutions were used by nearly 3,900 companies. As of March 
31, 2011, our hiring solutions were used by nearly 4,800 companies, including 73 of the Fortune 100. Our 
customers also include many small- and medium-sized businesses using our platform to leverage their 
limited recruiting resources. In 2010, our marketing solutions were used by more than 33,000 customers. 
This broad customer base provides us with not only diversification but also market validation for addi-
tional new customers.
•  Proprietary Technology Platform. Our proprietary software applications and technologies enable us to 
perform large scale real-time data and computational analyses that support our solutions. We categorize 
and query large sets of structured and unstructured data to personalize relevant information. For example, 
one of our key personalized recommendation features typically involves the processing of over 75 tera-
bytes per day, and nearly two billion people searches were performed on our website in 2010.

SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA
The following tables summarize the consolidated fi nancial data for our business. You should read this 
summary consolidated fi  nancial data in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated fi  nancial statements and related 
notes, all included elsewhere in this prospectus.
We derived the consolidated statements of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 
2010 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, from our audited consolidated 
fi nancial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. The unaudited consolidated statements of operations 
data for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2011, and the unaudited consolidated balance sheet data 
as of March 31, 2011, are derived from our unaudited consolidated fi nancial statements included elsewhere 
in this prospectus. We have prepared the unaudited fi nancial information on the same basis as the audited 
consolidated fi  nancial statements and have included, in our opinion, all adjustments, consisting only of normal 
reclining adjustments, that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the fi nancial information set forth in 
those statements. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the 
future, and our interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fi scal year.

18.12   Summary 435
18.11 Spotlight on Tesla
Tesla Motors is a California company that designs, manufactures, and sells elec-
tric cars and power train components. Tesla has two cars available: the Tesla 
Roadster, an sports car, and the Model S, a luxury sedan. Elon Musk, the firm’s 
CEO, envisions Tesla as an independent maker of electric vehicles.
Tesla is a fine example of a firm using many sources to obtain early growth 
capital. It raised nearly $200 million through five rounds of financing. Musk, 
who cofounded PayPal, put much of his own money into Tesla. He was joined 
by other wealthy individuals, such as Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry 
Page, and by a number of venture capital firms. In 2009, Germany’s Daimler 
AG invested an additional $50 million into Tesla. The company also received 
$465 million in loans from the United States Department of Energy. In 2010, 
Tesla entered the public stock market (symbol TSLA) and raised $226 million 
on the NASDAQ.
Tesla’s 2012 revenue exceeded $400 million. By 2014, Tesla may 
break even.
18.12 Summary
The entrepreneur leaders of new ventures create a set of financial projections 
that can be used to estimate the cash investments that will be needed as well as 
when they will be needed. Using that information, the entrepreneurs seek out 
investment capital. For the first or seed round, they may rely on their own funds 
and investments from friends and family. Eventually, most technology firms 
will need a significant investment from others such as wealthy individuals called 
angels or professional investors called venture capitalists.
Several stages of investment may be the best means of acquiring invest-
ments based on performance milestones for each stage. A real option is the right 
to purchase an asset at a future date. Thus, venture capital investors often use 
staged investing with milestones to exercise their investment opportunity with 
a start-up. For high-impact start-ups, it is the future value of the potential of the 
new firm that is most attractive.
Using venture capital valuation methods, a start-up’s value is established and 
an agreement on the division of ownership may be obtained. As the expected 
growth of revenues and profitability are achieved, the firm and the investors may 
wish to exercise an option to sell. This could be an initial public offering (IPO) or 
the acquisition of the start-up by a larger firm in order to harvest the value that has 
been created by the partnership of investors, founders, and employees.
Principle 18
Many kinds of sources for investment capital for a new and  growing 
enterprise exist and should be compared and managed carefully.

 CHAPTER 19
Deal Presentations and Negotiations
Leadership involves remembering past mistakes, an analysis of today’s achievements, 
and a well-grounded imagination in visualizing the problem of the future.
Stanley C. Allyn
How does the new venture present its vision 
and story and negotiate a deal with investors?
T
he creators of a new enterprise need to tell 
their story about the future of their busi-
ness. Establishing credibility and trust 
through presentations of the new venture’s plan 
for a novel solution to an important problem can 
lead to an investment.
The integrated story and the business plan 
should show how the business solution would be 
profitable within a reasonable period. The inves-
tors are interested in a favorable return. They 
also want to sense that they will be partners with 
trustworthy and capable entrepreneurs.
The negotiation of a deal with an investor is 
an important part of the process. One can cement 
the relationship or destroy it through the negotia-
tion process. The terms of the agreement should 
address the means of achieving potential return 
and the allocation of risk between the investors 
and the entrepreneurs.

CHAPTER 19   Deal Presentations and Negotiations440
The new venture team will be expected to verbally present its business plan to 
investor groups, angels, potential employees, allies, and suppliers. The purpose 
of these meetings will be to persuade them to cooperate, support, and participate 
in the new venture. Effective persuasion is a negotiating and learning process that 
leads to a shared vision. Formerly, people thought of persuasion as a simple pro-
cess: state the position or plan, outline the supporting arguments, and then ask for 
the action or deal being sought. Today, most would-be investors and allies want 
to engage in a dialogue with the new venture team. The team outlines the venture 
and invites feedback and alternative solutions. Persuasion involves compromise 
and the development of relationships with the investors and other participants.
New enterprises must be able to sell their story to potential investors and 
clients. Selling ideas is intrinsically difficult. Clients and investors are naturally 
risk-averse when it comes to large projects that call for large investments with 
payoffs that are many years in the future. They are even more risk-averse when 
the projects do not originate from within their own organization.
Effective persuaders first establish credibility. Second, they frame their goals 
in a way that establishes common ground with their listener. Third, they offer 
solid evidence to support their plan. Finally, they build a good relationship with 
their potential investors or allies. This four-step method of persuasion is summa-
rized in Table 19.1 [Conger, 1998].
Credibility and trust are established through experience over time. Thus, 
the shortest path to credibility is with someone the entrepreneurs already know. 
Otherwise, the entrepreneurs’ track record and references will be particularly 
important. The expertise required for the venture must always exist on the ven-
ture team. It may be useful to review the concept of influence and persuasion as 
described in Section 13.2.
The business plan must appeal strongly to the potential investor or ally. 
Framing the unique benefits of the new venture so that they match the goals of 
the investor or ally is critical. The next step is to provide solid evidence sup-
porting the business plan. Here, a vivid story or analogy will help to bring the 
plan alive. Finally, it is important to build a good relationship with the investor 
or ally. In this step, the entrepreneurs demonstrate their commitment to the plan 
and show some of their passion for the project.

19.1   The Presentation 441
A good presentation captures the listeners and lets them respond to the 
problem the entrepreneurs propose to solve. A four-part “pitch” appears in 
Table 19.2.
In presenting the business plan, it is also useful to answer the nine ques-
tions listed in Table 19.3. Of course, there will be other issues, but these nine 
are almost always part of a presentation. It is helpful to rehearse the presentation 
with an audience of a few trusted colleagues or friends who can respond with 
suggestions.
Trust is the basis of nearly every enduring business relationship. The pre-
sentation of a business plan is a vehicle for winning trust from potential investors 
and allies. Trust, confidence, and relationships are built over time. Speaking about 
the venture’s goals needs to invoke a positive response from the listener. What 
difference will it make if the venture is successful? Will people live better lives or 
enjoy new alternatives?
A successful pitch often follows the 10/20/30 rule: 10 slides, 20 minutes, 
and 30-point-font text. Most presentations to investors or allies should be based 
on about 10 slides that the entrepreneur can present in 20 minutes. Each slide 
should use at least 30-point font text. This will keep the listener interested and 
the presenters focused on their key  points [Kawasaki, 2004]. Table 19.4 out-
lines a sample 10-slide presentation. Renowned venture investor Guy  Kawasaki 
elaborates upon these slides on his website: blog.guykawasaki.com.
TABLE 19.2 Four-part pitch.
1.  This is a painful problem that customers 
need to solve.
2.  Many customers who have this painful 
problem have money to spend on allevi-
ating the pain.
3.  This company has a profitable and 
proven solution for this problem.
4.  The team has implemented and planned 
effectively in the past, and they can 
execute well in the future.

CHAPTER 19   Deal Presentations and Negotiations442
In any presentation, the speaker should convey a sense of urgency about the 
problem and a strong commitment to make the solution robust. Good speakers 
highlight the unique benefits on slides 3 and 4.
Listeners are swayed by the quality of the ideas but even more by evidence 
that the presenters are creative and innovative. The investors or new team mem-
bers seek to be part of a creative collaboration. The listeners look for passion and 
evidence that the proposed solution is a big change or discontinuity. Furthermore, 
the goal is to engage the listeners so that they become part of a creative collabora-
tion. The best outcome is that the presenters successfully project themselves as 
creative types and get their listeners to view themselves as creative collaborators 
in the process of building the new venture [Elsbach, 2003].

19.2 Critical Issues
We discussed the development of the business plan in Chapter 6 and the pre-
sentation of the business plan in Section 19.1. After the business plan is pre-
sented to a few potential investors, their suggestions and criticisms may require 
adjusting the business model of the firm or other parts of the business plan. 
Perhaps it is necessary to revise the product to make it more compelling. Offer-
ing a product that is “nice to have” for a customer is different than offering a 
product that the customer “must have.” It is nice to have vitamins available, but 
when one has a headache, an aspirin or Advil is a “must have.” Is the product a 
complete solution to the customer’s problem, or is it only a part of the solution?
Investors will ask: Are the people committed to the business, and is the 
opportunity large in potential? Can we identify and reduce the risks? Will there 
be a way we can harvest our return on investment? Is the estimated growth rate 
attractive?
The plan in written form and the verbal presentation should hold together 
as an integrated whole. Use of outdated or incorrect data will leave doubts for 
bye23429_ch19_439-450.indd   442bye23429_ch19_439-450.indd   442 10/30/13   1:53 PM10/30/13   1:53 PM

19.2   Critical Issues 443
investors. Unsubstantiated assumptions can also hurt a plan. For example, does 
the plan include an honest recognition of the competitors? Although passion is 
important, preparedness is critical, too [Chen et al., 2009].
The business plan and its associated story can be viewed as the keystone 
of an arch as shown in Figure 19.1. All the elements of the business model and 
leadership join together to form a whole.
It will help to validate a business plan if the new venture has paying custom-
ers at the time of presentation. It is even better if the firm is about to become 
profitable. Investors need reasons to invest. They want to see advance orders, a 
letter of intent, or a customer list. That shows proof of customers and how they 
value the firm’s product.
In 1968, Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce left Fairchild Semiconductor 
to found Intel. They brought along Andy Grove and several other colleagues. 
At Intel, they saw an opportunity to make a silicon transistor and later an inte-
grated circuit. Moore and Noyce were leaders in their field and knew Arthur 
Rock, a San Francisco venture capitalist. They asked him one day if he could 
raise $3 million to start Intel. Rock had secured commitments for the $3 mil-
lion investment by that evening. Moore and Noyce were well-known and could 
command a good deal for their new business. Most entrepreneurs are not as 
fortunate.
If the leaders of a new venture do not have a big, proven network and back-
ground, they will need to work hard to find and satisfy investors. They must 
convince them that their business is a one-time chance to get involved with 
something important that will exploit a big opportunity.

CHAPTER 19   Deal Presentations and Negotiations444
After the presentation of the business plan and follow-on discussions, an inves-
tor or ally may be confident about the potential venture but hold different expec-
tations about it. Thus, the investor and the venture team may have different 
views regarding the valuation for the firm and the appropriate terms of the deal. 
A good deal is one that fairly meets the needs of the new venture while enabling 
the relationship between the firm and the investor to flourish in the future. Thus, 
the pricing and terms of the deal must be balanced with the future of the rela-
tionship. If possible, the new venture needs to have alternatives to closing a bad 
deal. With a good alternative, the new venture can walk away from a bad deal. A 
new venture should understand its own interests and its own no-deal alternatives 
or options. Price, control, and ownership percentage are usually key factors for 
negotiation.
Investors will normally engage in a process of checking the backgrounds of 
the venture team, the market data, and the key elements of the business plan. This 
process, called due diligence, consists of verifying facts and data provided in a 
business plan before making a commitment to the terms of an investment deal.
Negotiating a fair deal is a skill that can be learned. Most entrepreneurs have 
limited experience negotiating a fair deal with investors. Negotiation may be 
defined as a decision-making process among interdependent parties who do not 
share identical preferences. Consider an example of a manager and an employee 
negotiating a pay raise for the employee. They are interdependent but have dif-
ferent preferences for the outcome. The employee wants a raise, and the man-
ager wants improved performance.
The best negotiation should produce an efficient, wise agreement and not 
damage the relationship between the parties. A wise or good agreement is one 
that meets the legitimate interests of both parties, resolves conflicts fairly, and 
is durable [Fisher and Ury, 1991]. One should try to avoid parties locking into a 
position, but rather reach for common ground.
The process of negotiating a good deal for all concerned can be based on 
four principles, as summarized in Table 19.5. Try to take personalities out of 
the discussion and avoid locking into positions. Try to get everyone working 
for a fair deal. Talk about the interests and goals of each party and avoid taking 
rigid positions, then generate several possible solutions that advance the inter-
ests of all parties. Finally, select the best solution with measurable outcomes.
Often negotiations will stall, and it may be best to try to reshape the scope 
and sequence of the negotiation. One or more of the parties can scan widely to 
identify elements outside of the deal currently on the table that might create 
a more favorable structure. For example, they may introduce new parties and 
terms to the deal and try to satisfy all parties [Lax and Sebenius, 2003].
Investors tend to have goals based on return on investment and time horizons 
to receiving this return. Entrepreneurs tend to have goals based on growth, suc-
cess, and achievement, as well as return on investment. Both parties need to help 
generate some good options so that there is room to adjust the deal. Finally, the

19.3   Negotiations and Relationships 445
TABLE 19.5 Four principles of negotiations.
1. Focus on describing the problem (task or deal) and take the people out of the discussion.
 Goal: All participants are solving the problem.
2. Focus on the interests of the parties, not their original positions.
 Goal: Each party states what they seek and the associated goals.
3. Generate a variety of options or possibilities that advance the interests of the parties.
 Goal: Several real solutions.
4. Create a final deal based on fair and objective standards.
 Goal: Real, measurable standards.

parties select a deal that gives them a fair solution to their needs. This deal should 
include measurable outcomes and adjustments in ownership or other factors if 
the agreed-to outcomes are not realized. Also, the deal should be a good start on 
a long, cooperative alliance between the investor and entrepreneur [Ertel, 2004].
In any negotiation, each side must choose between two options: accepting 
a deal or taking its best no-deal option. Typically, the best no-deal option is to 
move on to find and negotiate with a new investor. Thus, the new venture team 
evaluates the deal offered versus seeking another potential investor. Similarly, the 
other side is also considering losing the deal versus losing the deal’s advantages. 
The investor will accept the deal if it meets its own interests better than its own 
no-deal option, which is to lose a good opportunity. Thus, the negotiation problem 
for the venture is to understand and shape the investors’ perceptions and help them 
choose in their own interest what you want [Sebenius, 2001].
When making an investment, a venture capitalist considers three forms of 
risk: the market risk (establishing customers for the product), the technological 
risk (the extent to which the technologies or concepts are well developed and not 
threatened by potential competitors), and the management risk (the team’s tech-
nical and leadership competencies to develop the new firm). The venture capi-
talist wants to know which risks will be reduced by its investment in this stage.
Differences regarding valuation and ownership usually reflect differences 
in estimations of the future performance of the new venture. Therefore, it may 
be wise to develop an agreement that includes terms that are contingent on the 
outcome of designated measures or events. Using contingent terms in a contract 
enables the parties to bet on the future rather than argue about it. An agreement 
with contingences could include terms on such measures as revenues, profits, or 
number of customers achieved in an agreed-upon period. The actual outcome 
could lead to an agreed-upon ownership percentage. For example, the inves-
tor agrees to an ownership split of 70-30 (firm versus investor) if the goals and 
milestones are met but will reserve shares for a readjusted split of 60-40 if they 
are not met. Investors and new ventures can come to very different conclusions 
about many kinds of future events, such as sales and market shares as well as 
competitors’ moves. Whenever such a difference exists, so does an opportunity

CHAPTER 19   Deal Presentations and Negotiations446
to craft a contingent contract that both sides believe to be in their best interests. 
A contingent contract results in the two parties sharing the risk.
A common way to reach agreement about ownership is to offer a deal with 
warrants to tie ownership to actual performance. A warrant is a long-term option 
to acquire common shares, usually at a nominal price. For example, an investor 
may receive a warrant to receive an agreed-upon number of shares if certain per-
formance levels are not achieved by a certain date [Smith and Smith, 2004].
A factor that can complicate negotiations is the matter of dilution of owner-
ship by the founder group. Investors will usually seek an antidilution clause to 
protect themselves from dilution of their ownership percentage. This antidilution 
clause will usually be triggered by a lower price (down round) in a subsequent 
financing round. All the terms of an investment agreement, often called a term 
sheet, should be reviewed by the new venture firm’s attorney. A term sheet is 
a funding offer from a capital provider. It lays out the amount of an investment 
and the conditions under which the investors expect the entrepreneur to work 
using their money. The key is to remember that it’s just an offer, and the entre-
preneur can counter that offer and negotiate all the terms before finally accepting 
the funds. An excellent reference on these matters is The Entrepreneur’s Guide 
to Business Law [Bagley and Dauchy, 2011].
19.4 Term Sheets
The terms of the investment transaction are critical to the entrepreneur. The issues 
that concern professional investors are provided in Table 19.6. Clearly, trust and 
integrity are necessary between investors and the founding entrepreneurs. The 
venture capitalist willing to pay the highest price is not necessarily the person 
whom the entrepreneur will want most in the deal. Another venture capitalist who 
is not willing to pay quite as much may be a better partner in growing the busi-
ness. Normally, founders are required to earn (vest) their stock over time.
Professional investors will normally want preferred stock, which has 
claims on dividends, if ever paid, and assets before common stock owners. With 
all the factors involved in completing a financing deal, the new venture needs 
to engage an attorney to review any terms of the deal and perhaps represent the 
new  venture in negotiating the deal.
The terms of any deal should reflect the likelihood that the firm will require 
more capital at a later time. Many deals make it difficult to raise capital later 
at an attractive price. Often the deal is written on an assumption that every-
thing works out as planned—an unlikely outcome. The plan for the future should 
include reasonable methods of obtaining new capital infusions. Often the provi-
sions for protecting the investors in the current deal will be onerous if another 
capital infusion is required.
The terms of the deal should address the means of achieving potential return 
and the allocation of risk between investor and new venture. It may be better to 
lower the price to the investor and get the investor to share the future risk with

the new venture. The investors are looking for protection of their investment, 
and the new venture is seeking a capital infusion but needs to retain the right to 
pursue future capital infusions. Excessive protection clauses need to be traded 
away for lower prices for stock purchased by the investor. If possible, the inves-
tor should pay less for ownership and share the risk with the new enterprise. 
19.5 Spotlight on LinkedIn
LinkedIn was founded in December 2002 and launched on May 2003. It is a 
social networking website used primarily by professionals. The site is available in 
many languages and has more than 200 million users in more than 200 countries. 
The LinkedIn team gave a number of presentations to investors and partners 
as they grew the company. After examining the critical issues, Sequoia Capital 
funded LinkedIn in 2003. Greylock, Bain Capital and other funds joined Sequoia 
in subsequent rounds in 2005 and 2006. LinkedIn made a public offering of its 
shares on May 19, 2011. It’s IPO prospectus can be found in Chapter 18.
LinkedIn has a strong business model based on enabling professionals to 
gain favorable network connections and to build these connections into a sales 
and referral network. Today, the company is expanding its mobile presence and 
its use of interest groups and related media.
19.6 Summary
The potential for a successful new business can be communicated through a 
formal presentation. Through this presentation of the  entrepreneur’s story, the 
potential investor, new employee, or partner learns to understand the opportu-
nity and to recognize the competencies of the team members.
As investors become interested in the new enterprise, negotiations about 
valuation and performance milestones will commence. Conducting negotiations 
that retain and enhance the rapport with the investor is essential. The entrepre-
neur is negotiating until the moment of execution of an agreement and a transfer 
of funds. All the negotiations continuously address issues surrounding product, 
team, processes, business model, and intellectual property.

The presentation of a compelling story about a venture and the resulting 
skillful negotiations to close a deal with investors are critical to all new 
enterprises.
19.7 Exercises
19.1 Business plan contests offer an opportunity for entrepreneurs to present 
their business plans. The Clean Tech Open in the United States offers 
one such contest (www2.cleantechopen.org). Visit the site, study the 
description of the winners, and prepare a brief report on an enterprise that 
most interests you.
19.2 As the CEO of a new technology venture, you and your team have set a 
valuation for your firm of $10 million (pre-money) and found a willing 
venture capital firm. The venture capital firm, however, has set a valuation 
of $6 million. Revenues next year are projected to be about $6 million, 
and the firm will be profitable next year. Identify a negotiation approach 
for achieving a reasonable compromise valuation.
19.3 What is a term sheet? Specify three items in the term sheet that you 
would want as an entrepreneur. Specify item clauses in the term sheet 
that you would want as a venture capitalist. Why is it important for 
both parties to be happy with the resulting deal?
19.4 What are the key factors a venture capitalist uses to value a new ven-
ture? Describe what value parameters are most likely different between 
an investor and an entrepreneur.
19.5 What deal terms can a venture capitalist suggest to ensure entrepreneur 
incentives are aligned in both good and bad times for the firm? What are 
deal terms an entrepreneur would suggest to ensure investor incentive 
alignment in both good and bad times for the firm?
19.6 Why is it critical that the investor and the entrepreneur are both happy 
with the final deal? Who loses if this is not the case?

How do successful entrepreneurs transition

enterprise?  
C
reating a business plan for a new enter-
prise is important, but implementing the 
plan successfully is essential. Execution of 
a plan is a discipline for connecting strategy with 
reality by aligning goals and the firm ’s people to 
achieve the desired results. Execution is about 
turning a concept into a great business.  
New businesses move from start-up to growth 
to maturity in stages. Managing a new business 
through these stages requires different skills and 
organizational arrangements. Start-ups need to 
plan for having the right people in the right posi-
tions as they grow.  
Organizations, like people, need to learn and 
adapt to change. Organizing for recognizing and 
responding to challenges can build resilience in a 
start-up firm. The ability to adapt to change may 
be a firm ’s only truly sustainable advantage. Fur-
thermore, to achieve long-term success, a firm 
needs an ethical base for action.

CHAPTER 20   Leading Ventures to Success452
Execution  is a discipline for meshing strategy with reality, aligning the firm ’s 
people with goals, and achieving the results promised [Bossidy and Charan, 
2002]. Often, the unique difference between a successful company and its com-
petitors is the ability to execute its plan.  
Execution is fundamentally about turning a concept into a business. For 
example, after a short period, the firm may find its prototype has defects or the 
sales channel is not as attractive as originally thought. Every new venture runs 
into trouble before reaching fruition. Then it is time to reconfirm the vision and 
recommit to the execution task. This requires persistence and follow through.
While admitting mistakes, the team’s focus must stay on the long-term strat-
egy. For example, Cyrus Field tried four times to lay a telegraph cable across 
the Atlantic Ocean to link the United States and Britain. Using a new steamship, 
the Great Eastern, he succeeded in 1866 after nine years of effort. The saga was 
a dramatic example of Thomas Edison’s maxim, “genius is 1 percent inspira-
tion, 99 percent perspiration.” More recently, eBay faced a major challenge in 
the late 1990s as fraud started to increase. In 1998, the online auction firm cre-
ated an antifraud campaign. Nonpaying bidders would receive only one warn-
ing before receiving a 30-day suspension from bidding. At the same time, eBay 
offered free insurance through Lloyd’s of London. As a result, eBay became 
more successful. 
Execution is following through on the strategy of the business plan. Execu-
tion is also the process of determining how well a firm is performing, acting 
to improve performance, and ensuring accountability. Any firm with a sound 
business model and strategy is still only as good as the implementation of the 
strengths of the model and strategy. In preparing the plan, all the team members 
have built their expectations and strategies into an agreed-upon, coherent road 
map. Thus, the team knows what needs to be done. The next step is to agree on 
how it is going to happen. Who does what and by when? The team sets short-
term goals and priorities, and then assigns tasks to individuals. Rewards and rec-
ognition are linked to on-time performance. Since missing deadlines is costly, it 
is important to set realistic deadlines. Ultimately, the success of a new enterprise 
can be attributed to the execution skills of many team players rather than the 
decision-making skills of an omniscient entrepreneur. Six questions that can be 
effectively used to achieve solid implementation are provided in  Table 20.1 .   
The new venture needs team members with a wide set of capabilities so that 
one person can be responsible for several tasks. If necessary, additional people

may be engaged to accomplish unique or difficult tasks. These tasks flow seam-
lessly from the firm ’s strategy. The team describes where it wants to be by a 
certain time and then divides the tasks among its members. It is  critical to have a 
realistic assessment of the effort and time required for major tasks. The elements 
of an operating plan are tasks, milestones, and objectives. The leadership team 
will need to make trade-offs between tasks and goals so that the operating plan 
is realistic. A specific, written operating plan will help the firm to move forward 
efficiently. Also, reviews of accomplishments and the operating plan will help 
keep the team on task. Good execution is based on clear priorities, good assump-
tions, and constantly monitored performance [Mankins and Steele, 2005].  
Execution is hard work. The setting of goals and deadlines should be the task of 
those who need to accomplish the work. The establishment of priorities is a big part 
of sound execution. Tasks can be divided into  “must do, ”  “should do, ” and  “nice 
to do, ” with the priority kept on the  “must do ” activities as much as possible. The 
use of measurable goals and lists of necessary tasks and deadlines is very helpful.  
The culture of the firm, if widely understood and shared, can help the firm’s 
people to execute the strategy. With a strong culture and less formal direction, 
employees can take ownership over their actions and execute well. New firms 
can recruit, train, and reward people to take responsibility for their actions [Chat-
man and Cha, 2003].  
During the initial period following launch of the firm, one of the primary 
goals will be to build and grow revenues. One key measure that can help in the 
early stages of a business is the ratio of revenues to expenditures plus assets 
employed, called a business index (BI), where
BI 5   revenues
  ________________  
 expenses 1 assets  
 The goal of a business is to steadily increase the BI ratio by growing revenues 
faster than expenses and assets.  
As a new firm grows, one useful measure of sound execution is the sales-
per-employee ratio. A successful technology company will have at least 
$200,000 sales per employee. For example, as an emerging firm, storage and 
data management company NetApp had about $500,000 sales per employee 
( www.netapp.com ).  
An emerging new venture often needs help on operational issues as it moves 
toward growth. One source of help is the new firm’s suppliers and customers. They 
have in-depth capabilities that can often be accessed by a new firm. Often these 
large firms want the new firm to succeed and will lend a hand on tough issues.
Truly great companies execute flawlessly. They deliver products that 
  consistently  meet customer expectations. Furthermore, they empower customer 
representatives on the frontline to respond to varying customers ’ needs. Few 
competitive advantages cannot be quickly imitated. Therefore, a new firm needs 
to out-execute its competitors. It must continually under-promise and over-
deliver. The goal is to achieve almost perfect operational execution by constantly 
improving processes, training staff, and eliminating inefficiencies, as evidenced 
by such firms as United Technologies [Joyce et al., 2003].

CHAPTER 20   Leading Ventures to Success454
Execution can go wrong for several reasons such as (1) allowing the strat-
egy to shift over time and (2) failing at synchronization, which is getting the 
right product to the right customer at the right time [Hrebiniak, 2005]. Com-
panies often make a chain of mistakes that undermine the firm [Mittelstaedt, 
2005]. Failing to recognize mistakes and fix them can be fatal.   According to 
Paul  Graham, a successful investor at Y-Combinator, common mistakes that 
“kill start-ups” include hiring poorly, choosing the wrong platform, launching 
too early, spending too much money, and not narrowing in on a specific user 
problem [Graham, 2006].
Ultimately, a new venture can be said to execute well if its performance 
for its customers exceeds their expectations through all stages of its business. 
Ventures that execute well are organized around a prevailing vision and a 
 well-understood long-term strategy. They continually invest in new ideas, prod-
ucts, and people [McFarland, 2008].
Jim Collins [2001] describes seven steps to building a great business, as 
summarized in  Table 20.2 . If the new enterprise can implement most of these 
very well, it will have a good chance for success.   
TABLE 20.2 Seven steps to building great companies.         
1.  Leadership:  Be ambitious about the firm, possess strong will and resolve, desire sus-
tained results, and retain personal humility.    
2.  People:  Choose the right people, put them in the right positions, create a road map for 
success, and communicate it to everyone.    
3.  Success:  Show unwavering faith that the firm will prevail in the long run, confront the 
realities and facts, and respond.    
4.  Organizing principle:  Act on your passion, competencies, and economic engine to cre-
ate a core principle for the business.    
5.  Culture:  Build a culture of discipline where everyone is responsible for results; stay 
focused.    
6.  Technology:  Select a technology application that will accelerate the firm ’s momentum.    
7.  Momentum:  Build momentum slowly and consistently for the long run by constantly 
creating entrepreneurial projects.        
 Source:  Collins, 2001.     
Jack Welch, retired CEO of General Electric, is perhaps the best-known U.S. 
executive of 1985 to 2000. He advocated many principles and methods of 
execution, such as  “work-out ” and  “bullet-train speed. ” The key to Welch ’s 
popularity was his plain but powerful rhetoric about the critical issues of 
the firm [Lowe, 2001]. He insisted that each operating unit be number one 
or two in its market. While GE is a very large company, it retains today the 
atmosphere of entrepreneurial activity. General Electric meets all seven cri-
teria for Collins ’s great companies.

20.2   Stages of an Enterprise 455
A new venture can be said to execute well if its performance for its custom-
ers exceeds their expectations through all stages of its business. It is organized 
around a prevailing vision and a well understood long-term strategy. It keeps 
investing in new ideas, products, and people [McFarland, 2008].
20.2 Stages of an Enterprise
A new business venture is expected to grow over time, normally following an 
S-curve, as shown in Figure 20.1. The five stages of a firm are: start-up, take-off, 
growth, slowing growth, and maturity. During the start-up period, the firm is 
organizing itself, accumulating the necessary resources, and launching its prod-
uct. The second stage is take-off, when revenues start to grow. The growth stage 
is often the most profitable and is a time when management must look toward 
expanding its product offerings and/or serving new types of customers and/or 
geographic areas, as illustrated in Figure 20.2. This stage also entails high risk 
since the firm has little experience with these new goals [Roberts, 2003].   
Eventually, the firm’s growth slows in the slow-growth period. Finally, the 
firm reaches the mature phase. Figure 20.1 shows a high-growth trajectory and 
a slow-growth trajectory for two businesses. The high-growth firm experiences

CHAPTER 20   Leading Ventures to Success456
a growth rate of 40 percent per year or better. The slow-growth firm will have a 
growth rate of 10 percent per year.
Technology ventures needing a long start-up period for developing their 
product have to show success and raise their funds in stages. They continually 
must demonstrate credibility and engender trust in the investor community. The 
CEO and leadership of the venture must execute a creative and truthful strategy 
that unites the interests of the investors and the employees [Kleiner, 2003].  
Moving from start-up to take-off may engender serious stresses as manage-
ment practices that were appropriate for a smaller size and earlier time no longer 
work and are scrutinized by frustrated managers. High-growth ventures encounter 
fluid situations where rapid change and chaos occur. New products are released 
and marketing plans are in flux. New hires join the firm and  decision-making 
is too slow. With high growth rates, new capital infusions may be necessary. 
Long working days become common and the potential for employee burnout 
increases. As ventures progress through stages, the original founders may depart 
and be replaced by management professionals.  
A new venture on a slow-growth trajectory will enjoy a less-demanding 
workweek and fewer competitors but may be faced with limited profitability and 
access to capital.  
As a new firm enters the take-off phase, the need for additional capital, 
resources, and employees will lead to more regularized processes and increas-
ingly formalized communication. The take-off phase requires management skills 
and budgeting, accounting, and purchasing capabilities. By the time a firm enters 
the growth phase, the company moves toward decentralization and delegation of 
tasks. At this time, the firm may add midlevel managers for such tasks as purchas-
ing, fulfillment, and sales. In the phase called  “slowing growth, ” the challenge

When the business grows, the founding team is incredibly busy. Rapid 
growth puts an enormous strain on them. The business outgrows its production 
facilities and management capabilities. Typically, the management crunch hits 
in the third or the fourth year. That is when firms tend to outgrow their manage-
ment base with quality falling, delivery dates missed, and customers not paying 
on time. As the firm enters the growth phase, the leadership team needs to ask: 
what does the business need at this stage? Founding CEOs tend to depart when 
their firm reaches a rapid growth phase and needs strong managerial expertise 
[Boeker and Karichalil, 2002].

CHAPTER 20   Leading Ventures to Success458
eBay is an example of a successful move from take off to the growth stage. 
With a successful site and venture capital investment, eBay began looking in 
1997 for a capable manager to take it into the growth phase. It found Meg Whit-
man, an experienced manager with solid marketing credentials. Whitman arrived 
in 1998 and immediately worked on the execution of an IPO for September 1998. 
In the first quarter of 1998, more than $100 million in goods changed hands on 
eBay, and the company’s revenues exceeded $3 million a month [Cohen, 2002]. 
eBay sold about 9 percent of the company and raised $62.8 million. The IPO 
price was $18 per share, which jumped to $53 on the opening of the market. 
Whitman built a brand that promised trustworthy trading for buyer and seller. By 
the time she stepped down as CEO in 2008, eBay was a powerful auction firm 
with about $8.5 billion in revenues and an operating margin of 25 percent.
During the growth phase, it is also important to have financial leadership 
from a chief financial officer who manages the operating cash (cash flow), 
the capital expenditures, and any increases in working capital. The timing and 
form of capital investments can have a salutary effect on the profitability of 
the firm.
During the growth phase, competition heats up, too. Most products that are 
technology-based experience competition driven by technology, as shown in 
 Fig ure 20.3  [Hirsh et al., 2003]. As technologies like solar panels and hybrid 
engines improve, customers demand better performance with lower life-cycle

cost of ownership. Firms that respond to these demands will continue to 
 succeed.   
As the firm approaches the slowing growth phase, a move toward hierarchy 
may be appropriate. Hierarchy helps us to handle the complexity of large orga-
nizations. Furthermore, people envision career ladders, readily understand the 
system, and identify with one subunit. Hierarchical structures provide rewards 
of power and status, and may be the most appropriate structures for managing 
activities in large firms. The leader strives to keep the best of the small firm —
empowerment, teamwork, and shared leadership —while accepting the benefits 
of hierarchy in the large firm [Levitt, 2003].  
Often an analogy helps us understand the management of transitions. We 
can envision the early-stage company in the start-up and take-off as a jazz band 
playing in a jam session with wonderful improvisations. The jazz band has fewer 
than 20 members, and all the members know each other and seamlessly take 
their turn leading. Several players can play several instruments. When a firm 
grows to more than 50 people, it starts to shift to acting like an orchestra with 
its separate sections —strings, wind instruments, and percussion. The orchestra 
needs one coordinating leader, called a conductor. He or she has a score they 
follow and describes a strategy the orchestra will follow for each piece of music. 
They act as one —as should a growing firm.  
Changes in a company’s growth also can challenge its management and 
structure. Cisco Systems ’s revenue growth between 1995 and 2000 was over 50 
percent per year, primarily through acquisitions of small companies in exchange 
for Cisco stock. By 2002, Cisco ’s growth stalled, and the goal became manag-
ing expenses. The motto for the old Cisco was: faster, more sales. The motto for 
the new Cisco became: slower, better, profitable. From mid-1999 to late 2000, 
Cisco  doubled its payroll from 22,000 to 44,000 employees. In 2001, the growth 
abruptly ended when businesses stopped buying. Telecommunications compa-
nies discovered they had massively overbuilt and ordered too much equipment 
from Cisco. Revenue fell for the first time in Cisco ’s history. By the summer of 
2001, sales plunged one-third from their level six months earlier. By 2003, Cisco 
was cutting 8,500 workers [Thurm, 2003].  
In 1991, Motorola founded a spin-off called Iridium, LLC, to build a set 
of 66 low-orbit satellites that would allow subscribers to make phone calls 
from any global location. In 1998, the company launched its service, charg-
ing $3,000 for a handset and $3 per minute for calls. By 1999, Iridium filed 
for bankruptcy. As the CEO of Iridium said [Finkelstein and Mooney, 2003]: 
 “We ’re a classic MBA case study in how not to introduce a product. First, 
we created a marvelous technological achievement. Then we asked how to 
make money on it. ”   Not all ventures successfully reach the growth stage and 
beyond.

CHAPTER 20   Leading Ventures to Success460
Another organizational issue flowing through the stages of a company ’s life 
is the matter of executive succession. As the firm moves through the stages, it 
often must change its CEO, particularly during periods of either very low or 
very high growth [Boeker and Wiltbank, 2005]. As needs change, the board of 
Downturns and recessions happen in every industry. The response of an 
emerging business to these tests can lead to renewal and success or disarray and 
failure. Few companies have soared as high, sunk as low, and struggled to sur-
vive as the software maker Novell. Founded in 1983, it has a formidable compet-
itor, Microsoft, and has experienced large swings in revenues and  profitability. 
In the early 1980s, Novell pioneered the market for network operating systems. 
In the early 1990s, Novell missed the shift to the Internet and lost market share. 
Drifting through the 1990s, Novell tried for a renewal with Eric Schmidt as 
leader. Trying to move out of the slowing growth phase, Schmidt attempted to 
renew the innovation of the firm. By 1999, Novell launched new software for 
networks and the Internet. However, Novell revenues remained flat and profit-
ability remained elusive. Schmidt became CEO of Google in 2001.  
Managing a downturn is as challenging as managing a period of fast growth. 
In a recession, customers are slow to pay their bills, and suppliers become weak. 
Furthermore, the availability of new capital dries up. If possible, an emerging new 
venture can reformulate a positive agenda for managing through the down period 
by renewing and tightening its strategy while avoiding overreacting. An economic 
downturn is an opportunity to clean the slate and get back to economic reality. 
Every downturn is a chance to rebuild the core business. Contrary to conventional 
wisdom, downturn winners avoid diversification. Instead, companies that success-
fully handle a downturn refocus on their core business and renew their strategy. 
They maintain a long-term view and strive to earn the loyalty of employees, sup-
pliers, and customers [Rigby, 2001]. For example, in 2011, after several years of 
modest growth, Cisco elected to leave several consumer-related businesses and to 
return to its core switch and router business selling solutions for the data center. 
With a focus on the core business and a renewed strategy, the firm can see beyond 
the bad times. While managing costs, the firm prepares for the next upturn. If a 
firm has the resources, selected acquisitions may be a wise step for the future.   
As an author and partner at Kleiner Perkins, Randy Komisar [2000] describes 
a start-up as requiring three types of CEOs at successive stages of its devel-
opment. He cleverly uses descriptors in terms of dogs. The first CEO of a 
start-up is the  “retriever. ” This CEO assembles the core team and the prod-
uct to fit the original vision, and proceeds to access the necessary resources. 
The second CEO is the  “bloodhound, ” who must sniff out a trail and find the 
right market and profitable customers. The third CEO is the  “husky, ” who 
executes well and pulls the established firm steadily forward.

directors and the investors ask whether the incumbent has the skills to manage 
the firm through and into the next stage. 
Entrepreneurs often are unable to make the transition from start-up mode and 
consequently struggle to become effective managers of a high-growth firm. The 
habits and skills that make entrepreneurs successful at launching and initially grow-
ing ventures can undermine their ability to lead larger organizations. Entrepreneurs 
tend to focus on details and tasks in the early stage of a firm, as they should. As the 
firm grows, a leader needs to work on leading a larger, more complex  organization. 
Entrepreneurs can learn to grow with their firm by developing their relationship, 
networking, and strategic capabilities and by moving from a task-oriented approach 
to a coordinating approach [Hamm, 2002]. Still, fewer than 40 percent of founder 
CEOs make it past the second round of venture capital financing and fast-growing 
firms are especially likely to replace the founders [Bailey, 2003].  
Founders are more likely to remain if they hold a sizeable percentage own-
ership of the firm [Boeker and Karichalil, 2002]. The founder of the firm that 
addresses a solid opportunity and grows rapidly, however, faces a dilemma. On 
the one hand, the company can grow faster with the necessary funds from the 
investors and subsequently increase the monetary value of the firm. On the other 
hand, the founders find it necessary to cede control and important decisions to 
their investor group. If the founders want to get rich, they will probably need 
to cede control. If the founders want to retain control, they should consider a 
slower growth path and require less investment. Most founding CEOs initially 
want both wealth and control. Choosing between money and power forces entre-
preneurs to decide what success really means to them [Wasserman, 2012].
Successful executive succession can lead to superior organizational per-
formance [Dyck et al., 2002]. Succession planning is necessary for any new 
venture as it moves from one stage to another. The four factors of a good suc-
cession are sequence, timing, technique, and communication, as described in 
 Table 20.4 . Using the analogy of a relay race, there is a positive relationship 
between successful passing of the leadership baton and organizational perfor-
mance. Succession is facilitated when the incumbent and the successor have a 
shared understanding of the timing and technique of the hand-off.   
TABLE 20.4  Four factors of executive succession and the 
relay race analogy. 
      
 1.   Sequence     Ensuring the successor has the appropriate skills and experience to 
lead the organization in the next stage. The executive in the start-
up stage should have strong entrepreneurial skills, while the execu-
tive in the take-off phase should have good organizational skills.
 2.   Timing     Ensuring the leadership baton is passed in a timely and expedi-
tious way from incumbent to successor.    
 3.    Baton-passing     Methods used for passing the baton. Ensuring that the baton is 
     technique handed off as expected and the incumbent lets go of the power.    
 4.   Communication     Harmonious cooperation and clear communication between 
incumbent and successor.

20.3 The Adaptive Enterprise   
No business plan survives its ultimate collision with reality. Changes in the 
marketplace and competition require any firm to react to change. Entrepreneurs 
must determine whether the assumptions on which their organization was built 
match the current reality.  
Successful entrepreneurs have a deep knowledge of their customers and 
products, and know a great deal about what priorities matter to their customers at 
particular historical junctures. Furthermore, they learn from their experience and 
make rapid adjustments [Koehn, 2001].
Flexcar (www.flexcar.com) was started by Neil Peterson in Seattle to pro-
vide a time-sharing plan for automobile users. He thought that customers would 
use cars provided by his time-sharing company rather than buy their own car. 
This approach was popular in Europe, but Peterson found that people in Seattle 
still wanted their own car. He quickly learned to switch his marketing campaign 
to steer it toward universities and businesses, where the business model and sales 
pitch made more sense [Thomas, 2003]. Flexcar merged with Zipcar in 2007.
One of the biggest tasks for leaders in growing firms is to repeatedly  mobilize 
their companies to change to meet new opportunities and competitive challenges. 
The leadership team needs to reinvent its strategy through a process of continu-
ous renewal in a time of constant change; this process is called strategic learning 
[Pietersen, 2002]. A key capability of leaders in adaptive organizations is the 
capacity to adapt. These leaders do not get stopped by tough challenges they 
encounter but learn new lessons and go on. Aldous Huxley [1990] stated it as: 
 “Experience is not what happens to a man. It is what a man does with what hap-
pens to him. ”  Strategic learning  is a cyclical process of adaptive learning using 
four steps: learn, focus, align, and execute. This adaptive process of learning 
and executing, if done well, may be one of a company ’s sustainable competitive 
advantages. Challenging discontinuities are new technologies, globalization, the 
Internet, deregulation, convergence, and channel disintermediation. A firm ’s 
strategy defines how it will respond to its challenges. Thus, the leadership team 
needs to focus the firm ’s resources on the best opportunities in the shifting con-
text of the business world.  
A  learning organization  captures, generates, shares, and acts on knowl-
edge by revising its strategy as new knowledge becomes available. This type 
of firm is an  adaptive enterprise  —one that changes its strategy or business 
model as the conditions of the marketplace require.   Philippe Kahn, cofounder 
of Borland and Lightsurf, described adaptivity as improvisation [Malone, 2002]: 
“I don’t know what an entrepreneur is, but to me it’s the difference between a 
jazz musician and a classical musician. I think a classical musician is a kind of 
guy who’s gonna work for a big company. A jazz musician’s gotta work in a 
small band and know how to improvise. I think that’s really the analogy, that’s 
really the difference.”
In a small start-up consisting of 10 to 20 people with shared values and 
objectives, an informal process of developing renewed strategies will suffice.

20.3   The Adaptive Enterprise 463
As the firm grows, it needs to continue to renew its strategy as conditions in 
the competitive marketplace require. At that time, the ability to adapt becomes 
a required organizational capability. The leadership team needs to learn from 
its experiences, adjust its strategy, and execute those changes. Learning to deal 
with change, discontinuity, and uncertainty and adapt in a timely way needs to 
become a skill for leaders of new ventures [Buchanan, 2004].  
The effective management of risk is critical to success. Assessing the risks 
associated with new initiatives can help leaders make adjustments to mitigate 
these risks. For example, as leader of Amazon, Jeff Bezos is always asking what 
could go wrong and considering ways to mitigate the downside. Table 20.5 lists 
the characteristics of successful CEOs of adaptive  enterprises.
The learning organization, as described in Section 12.8, uses a learning 
 process or cycle as shown in  Figure 20.4 . The goal of the learning process is to 
generate new strategies in a cycle of renewal. The first step consists of a situation 
analysis (see Section 4.4) of the competitive marketplace, industry dynamics, 
and the firm ’s strengths and weaknesses. The outcome of this step is insight into 
the issue and alternative responses. The second step is to redefine the vision, mis-
sion, strategy, and adjusted business model. The outcome of this step is a state-
ment of the performance, resource, and capability gaps in terms of the desired 
strategy and the actual reality. The third step is to adjust the structure, process, 
people, and culture of the firm to work toward the new strategy. The outcome 
of this step is an adjusted business plan. The fourth step is to execute the newly 
adjusted business plan. The outcome of the fourth step is the actual adjusted per-
formance. After a period of actual performance, the learning cycle starts again. 
The firm continues to learn and adjust as it repeats the strategic learning cycle.   
Effective learning involves continuing to ask the key questions about cus-
tomers, competitors, capabilities, resources, and profitability. Entrepreneurs 
should not rely on excessive overconfidence and overcommit up-front resources, 
hindering their willingness to learn and adjust. The best degree of confidence 
lies at the level of willingness to decide and move ahead with the expectation 
that new knowledge will help the firm learn and adjust [Simon and Houghton, 
2003].

CHAPTER 20   Leading Ventures to Success464
Companies often conduct “postmortems” when they fail at a specific task, 
as with a failed product development effort, a failed product launch, or a quarter 
where revenue expectations were not met. These analyses enable the company to 
identify the factors responsible for the failure and to adjust accordingly. Fewer 
companies conduct a postmortem on their successes. Companies can learn a 
great deal, however, from analyzing the factors responsible for success and by 
determining the role of internal versus external factors. This analysis can keep a 
company from becoming overconfident [Gino and Pisano, 2011].
Most organizations face all kinds of unpredictable challenges that collec-
tively place huge demands on people ’s creativity and imaginations. Resilience 
is the ability to recover quickly from setbacks.  Resilience  is a skill that can be 
learned and increased. A resilient organization acts on its learning and possesses 
a staunch acceptance of reality, a set of strongly held positive values, and a pow-
erful ability to adapt [Coutu, 2002]. The firm has a clear, undistorted sense of 
reality about its competitive position. Then it needs the ability to make meaning 
out of difficult challenges. Resilient leaders build a new, improved vision of 
the future. Value systems of resilient firms evoke meaning and noble purpose. 
The third factor is the ability to make a future from what is available —a kind of 
inventiveness or ability to improvise a solution. Companies that survive regard 
improvisation as a core skill [Coutu, 2002]. Highly resilient organizations have 
the ability to read a weak signal of a problem and respond to it. Action tempered 
by reflection is the best method of responding to change and information [Coutu,

2003]. One way to identify threats and weaknesses is to bring in outsiders to test 
the resilience of the firm and its processes.  
In the early 2000s, IBM was losing market share in the hardware business 
and its software business was not growing at the same pace of many of its com-
petitors. Many doubted that IBM could continue to be a meaningful player in 
the information technology business. Under the leadership of its CEO, Sam 
Palmissano, the company divested non core growth businesses, including the 
PC manufacturing business, and invested heavily in building higher-margin soft-
ware and cloud computing businesses. IBM made a number of key acquisitions, 
including the purchase of the consulting division of Price Waterhouse Coopers; 
large analytics companies, including Cognos, Netezza, and SPSS; and core sys-
tem software companies, including Filenet and Rational Software. The company 
continued to grow and prosper, with IBM’s share price growing 73% during the 
tenure of Sam Palmissano’s leadership.
Amyris Biotechnologies is a noteworthy example of an adaptive company. 
Amyris was founded in 2003 by Dr. Jay Keasling, at the time a professor 
at U.C. Berkeley. In 2004, it received a $43MM grant from the Bill and 
Melinda Gates Foundation for the manufacture of a bacteria-produced anti-
malarial drug, artemisinin. Under the terms of the grant, Amyris would sell 
the drug at cost and make no profit.
By 2005, Amyris had succeeded in producing the drug microbially. The 
company now had both R&D funding and significant experience with the 
methodologies of synthetic biology. It was on the cutting edge of engineer-
ing microorganisms to become highly effective chemical factories.
In 2006, Amyris and its new CEO (John Melo) identified a new 
 opportunity. With rising fuel prices, biofuels were increasingly looked at 
as a potential solution to the world’s energy needs. With Amyris’s unique 
competency in bioengineering, it felt well positioned to take a leadership 
position in the biofuels industry. Amyris executed an IPO in 2010 that raised 
$85MM for the company as it entered the biofuels business derived from 
sugarcane. When scaling became a difficult challenge, John Melo and Amy-
ris adapted again to market needs and expanded into a third industry, cos-
metics and fragrances, in 2012. The company effectively adapted to market 
needs and expanded into other industries.   
Amyris Biotechnologies: Adapting to New Industry  
It is wise to build an adaptive learning enterprise from a new venture ’s 
inception. Competitive advantage depends, in large part, on the ability of 
organi zations to constantly change and reinvent themselves. They accomplish 
this through building and rebuilding a shared vision and team learning [Gabor, 
2000]. Adaptive organizations strive to learn to manage within complex market-
places. Complex, nonlinear, unpredictable markets challenge venture leaders to

learn to manage continuous challenges. To a great extent, the iterative, adaptive 
process of  Figure 20.4  is the only sustainable advantage for a firm in a dynamic 
economy.     
20.4 Ethics   
Life is filled with difficult ethical challenges.  Ethics  are a set of moral  principles 
for good human behavior. Ethics provides the rules for conducting activities in 
a manner acceptable to society.  Moral principles  are concerned with goodness 
(or badness) of human behavior and usually are provided as rules and stan-
dards of human behavior. Thus, a common moral rule would be: do not lie. Of 
course, such rules are subject to interpretation, exemplified by the concept of 
the “white lie.”  
Ethics is concerned with doing the right (moral) thing. Society also 
 establishes laws to guide actions. For example, U.S. law states that bribes and 
kickbacks are illegal. Laws are subject to interpretation, and paying a fee for 
sales help may be legal, while paying a bribe is illegal.  
The success of new ventures, either profit or nonprofit, depends on winning 
against competitors. The competitive marketplace can put pressure on the entre-
preneur to act unethically [Mishina et al., 2010]. The business leader finds it 
difficult to be fair to others without sacrificing customers or profits. The troubles 
of Enron and WorldCom show the poor practices that arise when competitive 
pressures win out over ethical principles.  
Ethical conduct may reach beyond the law, since the law is inadequate for 
every task. Doing the right thing is an undefined but helpful standard. One moral 
goal would be to tell the truth. Thus, a businessperson would try to  provide full 
and truthful information about his or her product or service. Telling the truth is a 
critical part of integrity, and integrity is the basis for reputation. Thus, firms, at 
the least, find it in their interest to be truthful. Fortunately, good ethics and self-
interest usually coincide, since most firms want to develop and maintain a high 
reputation [Arnold et al., 2012].  
Integrity can be defined as truthfulness, wholeness, and soundness. It can 
be described as a consistency of our words and our actions or our character 
and our conduct. A corporate model of integrity is based on ethical principles 
embedded in the corporate culture so that all stakeholders can conduct business 
to attain mutual benefits [Kaptein and Wempe, 2002]. A key task of a business 
leader is to establish an ethical culture [McCoy, 2007].
While firms have clear-cut business objectives such as profitability, they 
must consider them subordinate to ethical values. A firm’s integrity cannot be 
sacrificed to short-term gain. The firm’s moral compass points the way. The 
spotlight is on the CEO and his or her integrity.
People can have great values and still give way to error. One needs the com-
petence and character to implement one’s values. Often, major corruption begins 
with a single small misstep. As executives or employees take further actions that 
build upon or attempt to cover up this misstep, unethical behaviors can grow to

massive proportions [McCoy, 2007]. Firms and individuals face a number of 
obstacles to ethical decision making, as indicated in Table 20.6.
As one becomes an entrepreneurial leader, the pressures to win at any cost 
will become powerful [Harris et al., 2009]. To be a good team player, one may 
be asked to cut corners. We know that the lack of truth and the collapse of integ-
rity can lead to terrible outcomes, as illustrated in the Enron case of 2002. On 
Enron, Robert Bryce and M. Ivins write [2002]: 
Enron failed because its leadership was morally, ethically, and financially 
corrupt. Whether the question was accounting or marital fidelity, the execu-
tives who inhabited the 50th floor at Enron’s headquarters became incapable 
of telling the truth, to the Securities and Exchange Commission, to their 
spouses, or to their employees. That corruption permeated everything they 
did, and it spread through the company like wildfire.
The challenges of Enron extended beyond the company, too. Enron’s rise 
and fall was based on a partnership between its financial division and the invest-
ment bankers who put together the deals. “Enron loves these deals,” wrote a 
Chase banker in 1998, “as they are able to hide funded debt from their equity 
analysts” [McLean and Elkind, 2003]. On Wall Street, investment bankers call 
their innovative structured-finance arrangements their “technology.” In invest-
ment banking, the ethic for many was: “Can you get the deal? If you can, and 
you’re not likely to be sued or jailed, it’s a good deal.”
TABLE 20.6 Obstacles to ethical decision making.
Complacency: We believe that “it can’t happen here.”
Self-Delusion: We judge ourselves by our intentions, while others judge us by our actions
Rationalizations: We construct justifications and excuses for ethical missteps
Survival Mentality: We convince ourselves that ethical missteps are necessary

MiniScribe was a Longmont, Colorado, producer of disk drives that found 
itself in trouble when IBM canceled major purchasing contracts. When actual 
sales failed to materialize, the CEO badgered and bullied MiniScribe execu-
tives to meet quarterly revenue targets, no matter what it took.  Executives 
turned to cooking the books. Their  “cooking ” activities included counting 
raw inventory as finished goods, creating false inventory, and grossly over-
stating actual shipments.  
As MiniScribe ’s sales and profits continued to tumble, the pressures 
on the firm increased. At one point, executives rented a private warehouse. 
Over a weekend, staffers and spouses packed bricks in disk drive shipping

CHAPTER 20   Leading Ventures to Success468
Fortunately, there are a number of tools to help one act ethically. McLemore 
[2003] suggests two tests for difficult actions: (1) are things so questionable that 
you lose sleep over them and (2) could you live with the newspaper reporting 
your actions tomorrow? Ernest Hemingway wrote in his novel, Death in the 
Afternoon: “What is moral is what you feel good after, and what is immoral is 
what you feel bad after.” When difficult issues arise, contemplating them and 
engaging in conversation with other people can serve to encourage an ethical 
decision [Gunia et al., 2012].
Several tools for acting ethically appear in Table 20.7. For individuals, it is 
helpful to have a “personal business plan” that records the importance of vari-
ous activities and relationships and that sets goals for the coming year. Actions 
that deviate from this plan should be evaluated carefully. Individuals should also 
identify ethical “partners” who can serve as sounding boards and supporters. 
When confronted with unethical situations, McLemore [2003] wisely suggests 
you say, “I don’t feel comfortable doing that.” Of course, the risk of loss of 
TABLE 20.7 Tools for acting ethically in tough situations.         
 ■ Maintain involvement in a variety of 
activities and with a variety of people. 
This will help avoid being pressured to 
go along with what everybody around 
you says is acceptable behavior.    
 ■ Create a personal board of directors con-
sisting of people you admire and who 
possess admirable values. If difficult 
situations arise, call on them for advice.    
 ■ Keep a cash reserve of six months to 
a year of salary. This will allow you 
to escape further involvement with an 
unethical firm and seek other options.    
 ■ Increase your defenses to negative forces 
of influence and persuasion by reading 
a book on the subject such as Cialdini 
[2001].    
 ■ Apply the  “front, left-hand-side page of 
the Wall Street Journal ” test. Would your 
actions change if you knew they would 
be exposed publicly someday?    
 ■ Write down your personal core values 
for later use. They can provide a helpful 
reference in difficult times to remind you 
of what is important in your life.    
 ■ Take a break before making a decision. 
When feeling pressured, ask for time to 
leave the room and gather your thoughts.          
boxes, then shipped pallet-loads of them to  “BW, ” a fake customer. To pull 
off the brick shipping plan, they created a custom computer program called 
 “Cook Book. ” Over $4 million worth of  “very hard ” disks were shipped 
utilizing Cook Book.  
Once the fraud was exposed, MiniScribe ’s stock plummeted, and inves-
tors lost hundreds of millions of dollars, but not before the same executives, 
in an example of insider trading, sold most of their shares at a healthy profit. 
The CEO and CFO served time in prison. Unethical behavior most often gets 
exposed with severe consequences.

20.5   Spotlight on Intuitive Surgical 469
your position is real, but you can repeat without judgment, “I am uncomfortable 
doing that.”
For firms, it is important to have a “Credo” that makes values explicit to all 
employees. At J&J, for example, all employees must read, accept, and sign the 
Credo, which aligns everyone along a clear set of principles. When trouble does 
occur, an open and transparent approach is essential for maintaining trust and 
facilitating ethical responses [McCoy, 2007].
A person with an ethical mind asks herself, “What kind of a person, worker 
and citizen do I want to be?” [Gardner, 2006]. When circumstances are tempting 
you to drop your standards, life becomes difficult. With a firm belief in personal 
integrity, a person needs to be willing to resign or be fired for what he or she 
believes is right.   
Entrepreneurs should plan an ethical foundation for the firm so that they 
can build integrity and reputation. Maintenance of integrity is critical to the 
long-run success of any firm. Former Intel CEO Craig Barrett promotes a 
 “3M ” philosophy to help leaders make decisions with the right amount of 
integrity and ethics. The three Ms —manager, media, and mother —represent 
the three constituencies with whom leaders should be comfortable sharing 
their decision. Only if the leaders expect that their manager, the media, and 
their mother will all approve of their decision should they proceed with their 
chosen course of action.

Building an Ethical Venture the Intel Way  
20.5 Spotlight on Intuitive Surgical 
Intuitive Surgical Inc. is a company that designs, makes, and services surgi-
cal devices. The origin of the device called the da Vinci surgical system was a 
research project at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in the period 1990-95. 
In 1995, Dr. Frederick Moll acquired the rights to this research and founded 
Intuitive Surgical. The first da Vinci device was approved by the FDA in 2000. 
The device provides 3D vision and instruments that rotate and bend beyond the 
abilities of humans. These capabilities permit more effective procedures and 
smaller incisions that lead to shorter recovery times. The da Vinci system is used 
for prostrate, thoracic, and colorectal surgery.
Intuitive Surgical has grown to become a leader in surgical devices. Today, 
more than 2,600 da Vinci systems are installed in more than 2,000 hospitals 
worldwide. The system was used to perform approximately 450,000 procedures 
in the year 2012 alone. Intuitive Surgical continues to invest heavily in R&D 
and it recently developed a remote surgery device called Clearpoint, which has 
potential for use in urology, gynecology, and thoracic surgery.

CHAPTER 20   Leading Ventures to Success470
In 2000, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) issued an IPO, which raised $46 million. 
The company’s 2013 market value was about $20 billion. Its 2012 revenue was 
nearly $2.2 billion.
Intuitive Surgical is a strong example of a company that has leveraged 
 leading-edge technology to meet an important market need. By relentlessly exe-
cuting and by making strategic adjustments along the way, Intuitive Surgical has 
grown to become a model technology venture.  
Principle 20  
The ability to continuously and ethically execute a business plan and 
adapt that plan to changing conditions provides long-term success.     
20.6 Summary  
The implementation of a creative, well-defined business plan is essential to the 
success of a new enterprise. Good execution depends on the logical alignment of 
the firm ’s strategy with its goals and the efforts of its people. Turning a concept 
into a successful reality depends on goals, deadlines, teamwork, and focus on 
achieving the desired outcomes. Choosing the right people for the right jobs and 
helping them see where to go and how to get there are critical elements of build-
ing a great company. With the right people, a great strategy, and a sound road 
map, a start-up can strive to achieve an outstanding execution of the plan.  
A new business grows from fledgling start-up to growth to maturity in 
stages. Managing a new business through the stages requires varying skills and 
organizational arrangements. Start-ups need to have talented, multiskilled peo-
ple in place as they move through the stages of growth.  
Emerging firms are constantly subject to challenge and change. Organizing 
a firm for resilient response to these challenges calls for an adaptive corpora-
tion. The ability to adapt to change may be a firm ’s only sustainable advantage. 
 Furthermore, a firm needs to sustain its ethical principles through difficult times.

20.7   Exercises 471
20.7 Exercises  
 20.1 In May 2003, Zipcar of Boston decided it was time to bring in new 
funding to reach profitability (www.zipcar.com). However, the willing 
investors insisted on replacing the CEO and the board of directors. 
Examine Zipcar’s subsequent progress in terms of execution and need at 
different stages of the life of this company.  
 20.2 The global financial crisis in 2007–2010 drastically impacted the 
spending patterns of many businesses and industries. Select an industry, 
list specific spending changes that occurred during this period, and 
describe how a start-up selling into this industry should adapt its 
strategies to account for the broader market conditions .  
 20.3 Your emerging new company is selling a high-priced software system 
to the oil and gas industry. Each sale amounts to $100,000 or more. 
Your firm is scheduled to deliver a system next week to one of your best 
customers. However, your chief technical officer has just told you that 
they have found a major software error that will take two to three weeks 
to fix. You are counting on the sale within this month so that you can meet 
payroll and pay all your delinquent bills. Your CFO suggests you ship the 
system now and send in a team later to fix the error. Your CTO wants to 
fix it first and then ship. What should you do?  
 20.4 Southeby’s and Christie’s are the two largest upscale auction houses. Both 
enjoyed a growing business in the boom years of the late 1990s. In 2000, 
both firms were accused of price fixing. The Sherman Antitrust Act was 
passed in 1890 to control the power of trusts and monopolists. In 1995, 
both firms announced they would charge a fixed, nonnegotiable  sliding-
scale commission on the sales price. Is this the age-old tactic of price 
fixing? What constitutes legal pricing policies versus illegal price fixing?  
 20.5 Your cash-strapped company is bidding for a badly needed contract. As 
the bid deadline nears, an employee of your nearest competitor pays you 
a visit. He says he will provide details of your competitor’s bid in return 
for the promise of a job in six months, after the dust has settled. You 
know your competitor can survive losing this contract, but you cannot. 
Unfortunately, hiring a new employee will mean someone who currently 
works for you will have to go. Even so, is this an offer you cannot refuse?  
 20.6 Your new firm is considering offering one of two health benefit options. 
One is more complete but also more costly than the other. Should you ask 
your employees to accept the lower-cost option? Should you explain the 
benefits of both plans? If you do, most people will prefer the better plan. 
What should you do?  
 20.7 You attend a critical partner meeting with your CEO. After the meeting, 
your CEO misrepresents the results of the meeting to the broader 
management team to further a different agenda. How do you handle this 
situation with your CEO? With your other team members?

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
David Gal
Buzz Bonneau
Note: With permission by Calcula founders for use in educational only settings 
and environments.  
Each year, kidney stones account for 1% of all emergency room visits and $5.9B 
in health care costs1. Current kidney stone therapies are indicated only for stones 
larger than 10mm despite the fact that 85% of patients suffer from stones smaller 
than 10mm. These patients are prescribed narcotics and told to go home to pass the 
stone naturally over the course of several weeks. During this time patients revisit 
the ER, miss an average of 2.5 days of work, and suffer through acute pain onset 
that has been described as “the worst imaginable pain a person can experience.”
Calcula is developing products that solve this unmet need by removing kidney 
stones smaller than 10mm. Our minimally invasive, patent-pending device will ren-
der patients stone free after a single visit to the urologist without the use of general 
anesthesia. This opportunity represents a dramatic disruption in the field of urology.
Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) and Ureteroscopy (URS) 
are the two existing minimally invasive procedures to treat kidney stones. Both 
procedures fracture stones into smaller pieces and require specialized facilities, 
which include an operating room, general anesthesia, capital equipment, and flu-
oroscopy. Both take an hour or more to perform. The anesthesia risk and facil-
ity requirements of ESWL and URS render urological guidelines to recommend 
that patients with stones smaller than 10mm wait 4–6 weeks in the hopes of 
spontaneous passage before intervening. In addition, both require capital equip-
ment investments between $250K and $750K. 
Calcula has developed a precise method of stone removal requiring only 
local anesthetic. The product is based on early clinical testing from the 1980s, 
which proved the technique feasible and safe, but was never commercialized

Executive Summary 495
due to a lack of precision control and a fear of anatomical damage due to req-
uisite large instrumentation. Calcula has solved both of these issues with its 
novel device design, which includes precision software control and miniaturized 
design feasible only with modern manufacturing techniques. Calcula has veri-
fied the concept in animal models, and IP has been filed on the technology.
Calcula’s solution will fit under an existing CPT reimbursement code. The 
device is a planned 510(k) submission with both technology and intended use 
predicates. Clinical data is not required though Calcula plans to perform a two-
phased trial to drive adoption.  This data may be submitted with the 510(k) with 
with a clear endpoint (stone removal) and short follow up time (30 days). This 
regulatory path has been validated by Calcula’s advisors. 
In 2011, 1.45M patients had kidney stones treated only with pain medication 
because their stones were smaller than 10mm
2. Calcula plans to focus initially 
on those visiting the urologist with stones smaller than 10mm. Calcula plans to 
fully subsidize its $10,000 control system (compared to capital equipment cost 
of ESWL and URS - $750k and $225k respectively) and its disposable device at 
$275 (under existing CPT codes).
Rapid adoption of any new medical device is always a risk. Urologists may be 
hesitant to remove stones in the office setting because it is outside of current stan-
dard of care. This risk is mitigated by existing preliminary clinical data that proves 
the feasibility and safety of the technique. Additionally, thought leaders in urol-
ogy have strongly validated the Calcula approach. Calcula’s product will be easily 
deployable during an existing procedure, considered a “bread and butter” procedure 
in every urology practice. Calcula’s stone removal will be among the most lucrative 
procedures urologists perform due to the short procedure time and high reimburse-
ment. Clinical safety, ease of implementation, and fiscal incentive ensure that adop-
tion of the Calcula device will be rapid and widespread.

APPENDIX A   Sample Business Plan496
Calcula plans to fully subsidize the capital equipment cost for early adopt-
ers to drive adoption. Considering the disposable cost alone and conservatively 
assuming that 50% of urologist visits require intervention the initial addressable 
market is $400M. The total addressable market surpasses $1B when including 
the European market and console revenue. By treating patients in a single uro-
logic visit Calcula will save the health care system $1.1B/year
3. Calcula antici-
pates a requisite $24M cash burn in order to break even by year 5 following FDA 
510(k) approval, which is expected in late year 4.  Calcula is currently seeking 
$500K in seed financing to complete an in vivo animal trial in preparation for a 
$5M series A. We anticipate growing to 103 employees by 2018 in order to real-
ize the execution plan. See business plan for additional details.

APPENDIX    Cases498
 METHOD: ENTREPRENEURIAL INNOVATION, 
HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, AND SUSTAINABLE 
BUSINESS DESIGN 
It was spring 2007, and Method cofounder Adam Lowry sat deep in thought 
over enchiladas at Mercedes, a restaurant a block from his company’s office on 
Commercial Street in San Francisco. He began to sketch out ideas on a piece of 
paper to sort through the issues troubling him. As a company known for envi-
ronmentally healthy household products with designer brand appeal, Method 
was eager to develop a biodegradable cleaning cloth. Sourcing polylactic acid 
(PLA) cloth from China had not been in his plans, but every U.S. PLA manu-
facturer Lowry had talked to told him it was impossible for them to create the 
dry floor dusting cloth he wanted. And then there was the genetic modification 
issue. U.S. PLA producers did not screen their corn plant feedstock to determine 
whether it came from genetically modified organisms (GMOs). In any case, 
however, weren’t any bio-based and biodegradable materials a better alternative 
than  oil-based polyester, the material used by the competition? Yet certain major 
retailers were unwilling to stock products that weren’t certifiably GMO-free. It 
was hard enough to manage a fast-growing new company, but why were there 
some people who seemed willing to stop progress while they held out for perfec-
tion on the environmental front? The naysayers made him have to think care-
fully about what it meant to be true to the environmental philosophy that formed 
the backbone of his business. He had often said that Method’s business was to 
change the way business was conducted. But where did you draw the line? 
As a hot new company that had received widespread publicity for its dedica-
tion to environmental values and healthy, clean production, use, and disposal of 
all its products, Method had set high standards. In a relatively short time, it had 
created a model for excellence in integrating health and environmental concerns 
into corporate strategy. From only a germ of an idea in 1999, Method had expe-
rienced explosive growth during the intervening years. The company proved 
that home cleaning products could evolve from toxic substances that had to be 
locked away from children and hidden in cupboards to nice-smelling, stylishly 
packaged, biodegradable, benign products that you proudly displayed on your 
countertop. In 2006, Inc. magazine listed Method Products at number seven of 
the 500 fastest and most successfully growing firms in the United States. Method 
stood out in many ways from the typical entrepreneurial firm.

499  Method 
Leveraging only $300,000 in startup capital, twentysomethings Adam Lowry 
and Eric Ryan caused small-scale “creative destruction” across a $17   billion 
industry in the United States by emphasizing the health, environmental, and emo-
tional aspects of the most mundane of products: household cleaners. The com-
pany’s differentiating characteristic? Lowry and Ryan assumed from the start that 
incorporating ecological and human health concerns into corporate strategy was 
simply good business. By 2007, Method was growing rapidly and was profit-
able with 45 employees and annual revenues of more than $50 million. Its prod-
ucts were available in well-known distribution channels (drugstores, department 
stores, supermarkets, and other retail outlets) in the United States, Canada, Aus-
tralia, and the United Kingdom. Customers embraced Method’s products giving 
the company live feedback on the Web site, praising the firm and providing tips 
for the future. They were a loyal crowd and a signal that the time was right for this 
kind of business model. They even requested T-shirts featuring the Method brand; 
the company responded by offering two different shirts, one that said “Cleans 
like a mother” and another that simply said “Method,” both with the company 
slogan—“People against dirty”—on the back; a baseball cap was also available. 
Indeed, “People against dirty” was Method’s stated mission. From the com-
pany Web site: “Dirty means the toxic chemicals that make up many household 
products, it means polluting our land with nonrecyclable materials, it means test-
ing products on innocent animals . . . these things are dirty and we’re against 
that.” Under Lowry and Ryan’s leadership, Method shook up the monolithic and 
staid cleaning products markets by delivering high-performance products that 
appealed to consumers from a price, design, health, and ecological perspective—
simultaneously. From the original offering of a clear cleaning spray, Method’s 
product line had expanded by 2007 to a 125-product line of home solutions 
including dishwashing liquids and hand and body soaps. The “aircare” line, an 
array of air fresheners housed in innovatively designed dispensers, extended the 
product offerings in 2006, and the O-mop™ was added in 2007. 
All products were made in alignment with Method’s strategy. They had to be 
biodegradable, contain no propellants, aerosols, phosphates, or chlorine bleach, 
and had to be packaged in minimal and recyclable materials. Method used its prod-
uct formulation, eye-catching design, and a lean outsourcing network of 50 suppli-
ers to remain nimble and quick-to-market while building significant brand loyalty.  
Method sold its products in the United States through several national and 
regional groceries, but one of the company’s key relationships was with Target, 
the nation’s number-two mass retailer in 2007. Through Target’s 1,400 stores in 
47 states, Method reached consumers across the United States. International sales 
were expanding, and the firm was in discussion with new distribution channels 
regularly. 
An Upstart Innovator in an Industry of Giants 
The U.S. market for soaps and cleaning products did not seem a likely indus-
try for innovation and environmental consciousness. It was dominated by

APPENDIX    Cases500
corporate giants, many of which were integral to its founding. Although the 
soap and cleaning product industry was fragmented around the edges, with a 
typical supermarket stocking up to 40 brands, market share was dominated 
by companies such as SC Johnson, Procter & Gamble (P&G), Unilever, and 
Colgate-Palmolive. 
To put Method’s position in perspective, its total annual sales were approxi-
mately 10% of Procter & Gamble’s sales in dish detergent alone ($317.6 million) 
(2006). P&G’s total annual sales in the category were more than $1 billion. Fur-
thermore, the market for cleaning products was under steady cost pressure from 
private label brands, increasing raw materials prices, and consumers’ view of 
these products as commodities. Those companies that reported positive numbers 
in the segment between 2000 and 2006 did so by cutting costs and consolidating 
operations. Startups such as Seventh Generation and others attempted to pen-
etrate the mass market with “natural” products, but those products were largely 
relegated to health food stores and chains such as Whole Foods. For Method 
to have obtained any foothold in this heavily consolidated segment dominated 
by market giants seemed improbable at best. But for Method founders Lowry 
and Ryan, the massive scale and cost focus of their competitors offered an 
opportunity. 
Method to Their Madness 
“You have all your domestic experiences in that house or wherever you live,” 
Ryan explained. And so, “from the furniture you buy to your kitchenware, you 
put a lot of thought and emotion into what you put in that space. Yet the com-
modity products that you use to maintain this very important space tend to be 
uninteresting, ugly, and toxic—and you hide them away.” Lowry and Ryan 
didn’t understand why it had to be that way.  
They decided to take the opposite approach; if they could create products 
that were harmless to humans and the natural environment and were attractively 
designed with interesting colors and aromas, they could disrupt an industry pop-
ulated with dinosaurs. By differentiating themselves from the competition in a 
significant and meaningful way, Lowry and Ryan hoped to offer an attractive 
alternative that also reduced the company’s ecological footprint and had a posi-
tive environmental impact. “It’s green clean for the mainstream,” said Lowry, 
“which wouldn’t happen if it wasn’t cool.” 
To make green cool, Method took a two-pronged approach. First, it for-
mulated new product mixtures that performed as well as leading brands while 
minimizing environmental and health impacts. Cleaning product manufactur-
ers had been the target of environmental complaints since the 1950s, when the 
federal government enacted the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, in part to 
address the foaming of streams due to the use of surfactants, chemicals used 
in soaps and detergents to increase cleaning power. In addition to surfactants, 
household cleaners often contained phosphates, chemicals used as water soften-
ers, which also acted as a plant nutrient, providing an abundant food source for 
bye23429_appB_497-580.indd   500bye23429_appB_497-580.indd   500 12/2/13   11:56 AM12/2/13   11:56 AM

algae. Fast-growing algae resulted in algal blooms, which depleted oxygen lev-
els and starved aquatic life. Water sources contaminated with phosphates were 
also toxic for animals to drink. Another environmentally problematic compound 
in cleaning products was chlorine bleach, which when released into the environ-
ment could react with other substances to create toxic compounds. According to 
the Method Web site: 
A major problem with most household cleaners is that they biodegrade 
slowly, leading to an accumulation of toxins in the environment. The higher 
the concentration of toxins, the more dangerous they are to humans, ani-
mals, and plant life. The key is to create products that biodegrade into their 
natural components quickly and safely. 
With a degree in chemical engineering from Stanford University, and experi-
ence researching “green” plastics and at a climate-change think tank, Lowry saw 
these issues as opportunities. 
Method counted on the competition’s seeing environmental and health 
issues as “problems.” Doing so allowed Method to seize competitive advantage 
through designing out human health threats and ecological impacts from the 
start, while their larger competitors struggled to deal with increasing legisla-
tive and public image pressures. Method products sold at a slight premium to 
compensate for the extra effort. “I knew as a chemical engineer that there was no 
reason we couldn’t design products that were nontoxic and used natural ingredi-
ents,” Lowry said. “It would be more expensive to do it that way. But that was 
okay as long as we created a brand that had a ‘premiumness’ about it, where our 
margins would support our extra investments in product development and high-
quality ingredients.”  
The second prong of Method’s attack on the entrenched cleaning products 
industry was to utilize design and brand to appeal to consumers tired of the same 
old products. In an industry rife with destructive price competition, Method real-
ized it would have to be different. The founders believed that their competition 
was so focused on price that “they weren’t able to invest in fragrance or interest-
ing packaging or design.” Lowry explained: 
Our idea was to turn that reality on its head and come up with products 
that absolutely could connect with the emotion of the home. We wanted to 
make these products more like “home accessories.” We believed there was 
an opportunity to really reinvent, and in the end, change the competitive 
landscape. 
By focusing their marketing and packaging as the solution “against dirty,” 
they tapped into consumers’ disquiet with the ingredients in their household 
cleaners. Through packaging that stood out from the rest, they created the 
opportunity to deliver the environmental and health message of the products 
ingredients. 
Design of packaging to deliver that message was integral to Method’s suc-
cess from its first sale. Method’s home-brewed cleaning formulas for kitchen,

shower, bath, and glass surfaces were all originally packaged in clear bottles 
that stood out on a shelf. “The manager of the store just liked the way the 
packaging looked,” said David Bennett, the co-owner of Mollie Stones, a San 
Francisco Bay–area grocer that was Method’s first retail customer. “It looked 
like an upscale product that would meet our consumer demands, so we went 
with it.”  
Design continued to be a key element of Method’s appeal, with the recruit-
ing of Karim Rashid, a renowned industrial designer who had worked with Prada 
and Armani. Rashid was responsible for bringing a heightened sense of style to 
Method’s packaging, while continuing to focus on environmental impact. This 
led to the use of easily recycled number-one and number-two plastics (the types 
of plastic most commonly accepted by municipal recycling centers). Method’s 
approach seemed to represent a younger generation’s more holistic mental 
model. This small firm seemed to provide a window into a future where health, 
environmental, and what were increasingly called “sustainability issues” would 
be assumed as part of business strategy and product design. 
Wipes, the O-mop™, and PLA Material 
PLA was an innovative and relatively new plastic material derived from plants 
such as corn, rice, beets, and other starch-based agricultural crops. PLA biode-
graded at the high temperatures and humidity levels found in most composting 
processes. NatureWorks was the first large-scale plant in the United States to 
produce PLA in resin (pellet) form, based on milled material made from farm-
supplied corn and corn waste. The resin pellets went to a fiber manufacturer who 
made bales; those bales of PLA material went next to the nonwoven cloth manu-
facturer, who converted it into giant rolls of nonwoven cloth. Next, a converter 
took the bulk nonwoven cloth, cut it into shapes, and packaged it according to 
the specifications of a customer such as Method. When NatureWorks first began 
operations, demand was limited. That picture changed quickly between 2004 
and 2006, and by 2007 the plant could not produce its PLA feedstock resins fast 
enough to meet worldwide demand. PLA came out of the facility in pellet form 
and was melted, extruded, spun, and otherwise manipulated by converters at dif-
ferent steps down the supply chain into a virtually endless spectrum of materials 
for different applications across a wide range of product categories.  
As a replacement for ubiquitous oil-based plastic feedstock, PLA promised a 
departure from the petroleum-based plastic materials that had come to dominate 
since synthetic plastics were first developed in volume after World War II. PLA 
had proved itself a particularly high-performing and cost-effective raw material 
that was well suited as a substitute for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in many 
applications. PET was the oil-based polymer known generically as polyester and 
used extensively in packaging, films, and fibers for textiles and clothing.  
The competition’s wipes and mop heads were made of petroleum-based non-
biodegradable plastic material, typically polyester or polypropylene. Although 
microfiber was quickly becoming commonplace, microfiber and the denier unit 
bye23429_appB_497-580.indd   502bye23429_appB_497-580.indd   502 12/2/13   11:56 AM12/2/13   11:56 AM

of measurement were first associated with material in women’s hosiery. Tech-
nology advances permitted polyester microfiber production for very fine fiber 
applications, and just as microfiber had become common in clothing lines, it was 
also used as a more effective wiping and cleaning product. 
Microfiber was fiber with strands measured at less than one denier, a unit of 
weight used to describe extremely fine filaments and equal to a yarn weighing 
one gram per 9,000 meters. Whether made from corn or oil, microfiber material, 
used by most companies selling residential cleaning wipes by 2006, made an 
excellent cleaning cloth. Its structure enabled the fiber surface to more effec-
tively pick up dirt and dust compared with conventional materials and methods. 
The microfiber wipes could be washed and reused, providing greater durability 
than alternative products that were typically thrown away immediately after use.  
Consistent with Method’s environmental and sustainability philosophy, 
Lowry wanted to use biobased materials, specifically PLA nonwoven cloth, for the 
dry floor dusting product. Ultimately he wanted PLA to be the basis for all fibers 
used, both nonwoven disposable cloth and reusable woven microfiber. If custom-
ers weren’t grabbed by the marketing message that the mop was sexy and hip (a 
message consistent with Method’s playful tone) they might be pulled in by the 
ergonomic O-mop’s more effective, biotech-based, and nontoxic floor cleaning.  
Lowry knew most disposable wipes ended up in landfills, not compost piles, 
even with their extended life. So the company supported municipal recycling 
and composting infrastructure development in an effort to encourage cradle-to-
cradle
1 resource use, or at least raise awareness and encourage behavior in that 
direction. Method estimated that 83,000 tons of “wipe” material made of poly-
ester or polypropylene plastic was ending up in landfills annually, enough to fill 
9,000 tractor-trailers. If using PLA could reduce oil feedstock use even a little, 
he reasoned, it was an improvement. Even if the PLA fiber went to landfills, 
where temperature and humidity never reached the ideal composting levels that 
would quickly and thoroughly break it down, it would still decompose safely, 
perhaps after one to two months, unlike oil-based fibers, which could remain in 
landfill disposal sites in the same condition for thousands of years.  
The market for biobased plastic materials had taken off by 2007, but Lowry 
had had no luck finding a U.S. manufacturer to create a PLA-based fabric suit-
able for the white nonwoven dry floor duster cloth used with the O-mop. He had 
just talked with the last on his list of PLA manufacturers, and the answer was 
no. They had all told him it couldn’t be done. The material was too brittle, they 
couldn’t process it, it wouldn’t run on their machines, and the strands were too 
weak: PLA nonwoven cloth for this application was technologically impossible.  
He picked up the phone and placed a call to a company he knew in China—
a departure from business as usual given that 90% of Method’s inputs were 
1 “Cradle-to-cradle” was an increasingly popular term that referred to a product cycle in which materials 
could be manufactured, used, then broken down and used again with no loss of quality; for more infor-
mation on this concept, see William McDonough and Michael Braungart’s Cradle-to-Cradle: Remaking 
the Way We Make Things (North Point Press, 2002).

APPENDIX    Cases504
sourced in the United States. Chinese suppliers often were excellent, but 
domestic sourcing was preferable to avoid the high transportation costs of mov-
ing product long distances. Typically the farther the transport requirement, the 
greater the fossil fuel use, so the choice seemed inconsistent with the firm’s sus-
tainability approach. But Lowry was sure the dry floor dusting cloth could be 
made with PLA resins, and the Chinese manufacturer confirmed it. He placed 
the order. A Taiwanese fiber manufacturer would make the bales, and send 
them to the Chinese nonwoven cloth manufacturer that would pass the cloth 
on to a converter close by that would in turn cut and package to meet Method’s 
needs. He knew the suppliers were good and reliable, and that the product would 
arrive promptly. Perhaps all Method’s PLA products would need to come from 
China. But was sourcing from the other side of the world “sustainable” in the 
sense that he and Ryan tried to apply sustainability principles to the company’s 
operations? 
The other issue on his mind was that Method’s products could be deemed 
unacceptable in certain distribution channels that would not tolerate any geneti-
cally engineered organisms in their products. PLA was produced from agri-
cultural material (often corn or cornfield waste material) that was brought by 
farmers to a centrally located milling plant that converted it and separated 
out the components from which PLA was made. There was no monitoring of 
the corn coming into the milling facility, thus there was no guarantee that all 
inputs to the PLA resin-producing process were free of GMOs. If Lowry used 
PLA, it meant certain large and reputable buyers would refuse to put Method 
products on their shelves. Even so, to Lowry, it seemed preferable to substitute 
PLA for petroleum-derived products and compromise on the GMO issue for 
the time being. After a particularly discouraging conversation with a company

METHOD PRODUCTS:
SUSTAINABILITY INNOVATION AS ENTREPRE-
NEURIAL STRATEGY
Introduction
Method Products, Inc., had hit a sweet spot for its buyers by 2010. Since its 
founding in 2000, the privately held Method had had a clear mission: Make 
good-smelling, high-performing household cleaners that were healthy through-
out their material life spans and packaged in attractive, eye-catching, and eco-
designed containers. Said Adam Lowry, cofounder and chief “greenskeeper”:
We wanted to change the way people view home cleaning. There is a dis-
connect between the way people feel about and care for their homes and 
the design of the products they use to clean them. We set out to evolve the 
household cleaner from an object that lived under the sink to a countertop 
accessory and must-have item by providing cool-looking, effective, non-
toxic products that are healthy for both the environment and the home.
As scientific studies revealed growing health problems associated with chemi-
cal exposure and regulation of chemicals steadily rose around the world, more 
informed customers were seeking effective but healthier cleaning product 
options on retail shelves.
Despite the company’s small size and entrepreneurially disruptive approach, 
Method’s stylish cleaning products had quickly become state of the art in an 
industry moving toward sustainable business thinking. “We want to be thought 
leaders and we want to evoke change,” said cofounder and design guru Eric 
Ryan. Method had in fact altered the once staid market for cleaning products in 
which large competitors traditionally fought over shelf facings, thin margins, 
and fractional market share points. Method introduced a three-times-more- 
concentrated laundry detergent in 2004 that contributed to Wal-Mart’s requiring 
all detergent suppliers to concentrate their products to save resources on packag-
ing and shipping. In 2006, Method began getting many of its products Cradle-to-
Cradle-certified by McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry. This certification 
meant the products were nontoxic and used fewer resources throughout their 
life cycles. The next year, Method became one of the founding B Corporation 
(http://www.bcorporation.net [accessed August 30, 2010]), a form of company

that built environmental and social goals into its charter and passed third-party 
standards for sustainable practices. Method also worked through its public com-
munications and Web site to express the goals and values that were an integral 
part of its company culture and products—that is, protecting health, children, 
and pets through eco-friendly and socially conscious products designed from a 
full life-cycle perspective.
Yet Method wanted to go further. “Our business model is to try to catalyze 
the next chapter of innovation within our product categories,” Lowry said.
1 He 
and the company aspired to launch two major products a year. In 2008, Method 
turned to laundry detergents, a several billion-dollar market in the United States 
alone. It devised an eight-times-concentrated detergent in an encapsulated tablet, 
or monodose format, which would further save packaging and product materials 
and drastically reduce manufacturing and distribution of energy usage. The con-
sumer could toss the tablet in with a load of laundry. It was convenient, efficient, 
less messy, and prevented using excess soap in each laundry load.
At a critical point in the product development process, everything about the 
monodose was working except one thing: The gel that encapsulated the detergent 
didn’t dissolve entirely in cold water, a result of the company’s decision not to 
use animal-derived ingredients such as the gelatins most often used for capsules. 
A bit of the plant-based gel casing could remain in the washing machine during 
the rinse cycle. Could Method and its loyal customers accept the residue as the 
price for a much more concentrated and environmentally compatible detergent 
formulation? Method could turn to petroleum-derived or gelatin capsules rather 
than plant-based materials for the capsule in order to solve the problem. Alter-
natively, the company could abandon the monodose concept and its inherent 
benefits. Lowry and his team contemplated what to do.
The Emergence of Method
Lowry and Ryan knew each other growing up in Michigan, where both their 
families had entrepreneurial companies that became significant suppliers to the 
automobile industry. Lowry earned his bachelor of science in chemical engi-
neering from Stanford University and worked on climate change policy at the 
Carnegie Institution for Science, an organization that focused on innovation and 
discovery. There, he helped develop software tools for the study of global climate 
change. In his post-college work experience, Lowry honed his unique approach 
to commercial environmentalism, which would form the basis of Method’s suc-
cess. And through his combined education and employment, Lowry became 
convinced that business was “the most powerful agent for positive change on 
the planet. But it’s not business as we know it today. It is fundamentally and 
profoundly different. It is business redesigned.”

In 2006, Ryan was named one of Time magazine’s eco-leaders and received 
similar accolades from Vanity Fair. Ryan attended the University of Rhode 
Island and went into marketing, eventually doing work for the Gap and Saturn. 
The old high school classmates ran into each other on an airplane in 1997 and 
realized they lived on the same block of Pine Street in San Francisco. They 
soon thereafter became roommates, helping to maintain a house full of college 
fraternity brothers. As the story went, no one liked to clean. The two spent time 
discussing what was cool and what was not in commercial markets—and hence 
ripe for innovation. The pair settled on cleaning products, a bastion of typically 
harsh, dangerous chemicals—definitely not cool.
Lowry and Ryan used their bathtub to mix their own cleaners from natural, 
fragrant, and gradually more benign and renewable ingredients. Initial funding 
of $300,000 was provided through convertible debt from friends and family. 
They filled one beer pitcher at a time with their cleaners and made their first 
sale in February 2001 to a local grocery store—an order they then scrambled 
to fill from their bathtub. The next day, Lowry and Ryan hired their new boss, 
an entrepreneurial CEO with an MBA and years of experience in the consumer 
packaged goods industry.
The founders knew presentation would matter when it came to making an 
impression on customers. Lowry said:
[We want to] inspire a happy, healthy home revolution. . .We want it to 
be happy because, in our opinion, way too much of the green movement 
has been heavy handed in sort of an education-based instead of inspiration-
based [way]. That’s one of the reasons that you see us concentrating so 
much on making our products not only work great and be green but be beau-
tiful as well.

They cold-pitched New York-based industrial designer Karim Rashid, 
whose aesthetically appealing work had appeared in museums, and he accepted 
the offer to design for Method. Soon, his designs would appear on countertops 
across the country. Rashid’s name and Ryan’s contacts got Method a pilot deal 
with Target to sell its products at 200 stores around Chicago and San Francisco. 
Method found a contract manufacturer to scale up production. Method’s com-
mitment to excellence and attention to detail impressed Target, especially after a 
problem with leaky containers led Lowry and other Method employees to walk 
through Target and pull the leaky bottles off the shelves themselves; their con-
tainer supplier quickly corrected the problem.
Method’s growth accelerated even as the company stayed true to its core 
values of style and social and environmental soundness. Target decided to carry 
Method products in all its stores, and Method went from having $16 in cash, 
credit card debt, and arrears to vendors in 2001 to profitability in 2005.

APPENDIX    Cases508
Method experienced rapid growth, ending the year with about 45 employees, 
50 vendors and suppliers, and a foothold in the United Kingdom. The next year 
pushed sales to $71 million. 5 Method expanded rapidly from hand soaps and 
countertop cleaners to body washes, floor cleaners, dish soaps, and laundry 
detergents. These products were carried by large retail chains such as Costco, 
Target, Lowe’s, and Whole Foods and generated over $100 million in revenue 
by 2010. Method’s former CEO distilled the company’s approach for success in 
2006: “Method has to enter a category with a huge disruption. The story cannot 
be copied overnight or eroded by competitors. It has to have disruptive packag-
ing, ingredients, and fragrance.”
6
The company also continued to use naturally occurring or naturally derived 
ingredients as much as possible. If synthetic ingredients were needed, they were 
screened for biodegradability and toxicity to humans and the environment but 
without the use of animal testing. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals 
(PETA) gave Lowry and Ryan its 2006 award for Person of the Year. The found-
ing duo wrote a guidebook in 2008 titled Squeaky Green: The Method Guide 
to Detoxing Your Home. Their company, meanwhile, strove to reduce its car-
bon footprint through efficiency, switching to biodiesel trucks, or buying offsets 
such as methane digesters for manure at three Pennsylvania dairy farms. It also 
became the first company to introduce a custom-made bottle manufactured from 
100% post-consumer recycled (PCR) polyethylene terephthalate (PET), whose 
recycling number, as part of the resin identification code, was one.
Despite its innovation, growth, and sterling public image, Method remained 
tiny relative to the competition. While Seventh Generation, an established pro-
ducer of green cleaners and a fellow B Corporation, had sales comparable to 
Method’s, generating $93 million in revenue in 2007 and over $120 million the 
following year, the makers of conventional cleaning products were orders of 
magnitude larger. One of the largest companies in the world, Procter & Gamble 
(P&G), had a market capitalization of $180 billion in April 2010, and its House-
hold Care business unit alone had sales of $37.3 billion in 180 countries in 2009. 
P&G’s laundry detergents in 2009 included Tide, the first synthetic heavy-duty 
detergent launched in 1946 and a now billion-dollar brand; Gain, another bil-
lion-dollar brand; Ace and Dash, each of which generated over $500 million in 
sales; and Cheer.
7 In short, P&G’s laundry detergents dominated that market and 
by themselves generated more than 30 times Method’s revenue.
Other giants, with broad product portfolios, also operated in the laundry 
detergent market. In 2009, Unilever, also a food producer, had total sales of 
about $55 billion. Colgate-Palmolive, known for toothpastes and dish soaps, had 
sales of $15 billion. Clorox, best known for its chlorine bleach, had sales of 
$5.5 billion. Clorox also had proven particularly adroit at moving into the green

cleaning market. It launched its Green Works line in the United States in 2008, 
rapidly expanded into 14 countries, and, according to the company, captured 
47% of the natural cleaner market from mid-2008 to mid-2009, more than dou-
bling the closest competitor’s share. Church & Dwight Co., makers of Arm & 
Hammer brand baking soda, pulled in another $2.5 billion in sales in 2009 and 
marketed a series of baking-soda-based green cleaners and laundry detergents 
under its Arm & Hammer Essentials line.
8
As Method mulled its own new laundry detergent, it remained very much 
aware of its smaller stature. As Eric Ryan told Inc. magazine in 2007, “When 
you run through the legs of Goliath, you need to spend a lot of time thinking 
about how to act so you don’t put yourself in a place you can be stepped on.” 9 
Josh Handy, the lead Method designer, made a similar point:
Where we’ve gone awry sometimes is when we’ve forgotten how small we are 
and therefore while we talked about ourselves as being the biggest green brand 
in the world, which typically we were, that’s the wrong mindset for Method. 
What we are is the 35th-smallest cleaning products brand in the world.
Handy understood that Method’s work environment had to support the creativity 
required for David-esque innovation. After Handy came to Method, he actively 
encouraged people to break rules in order to innovate, at one point literally 
drawing on a piece of furniture. Other employees followed his lead, and soon 
a room of once-uniform and uncomfortable white furniture was thus decorated 
and dubbed “the Wiggle Room.” Commitment to giving people and ideas room 
to “wiggle” was serious. The mission was stated as “Keep it weird, keep it real, 
keep it different,” and, as Eric Ryan commented:
We don’t build rockets over here; we build soap. And it’s hard to be differ-
ent in soap. So ideas have to be flowing. We have to have an environment 
where people are comfortable sharing ideas. We do everything we can to 
make people as connected as possible. We have to have every brain in the 
game. The more different an idea, the more fragile it is and the more likely 
it is beaten down and doesn’t go anywhere. We have to cultivate our ability 
to be different, to be open to ideas. It means putting as much work into the 
culture as the product you are creating.
Concentrating the Formula and Pushing the Monodose to Failure
When Method decided to pursue an improved detergent in early 2008, it turned 
the matter over to its team of “green chefs,” including Fred Holzhauer, whom 
Lowry characterized as being “as close to a true mad scientist as anyone I’ve

ever met.” Lowry gave the green chefs the mission of creating a better deter-
gent and trusted them to figure out the details. “What we do is set up a system,” 
Lowry explained, “a way of working, an environment that allows the innovation 
to occur within the boundaries that we want.” Drummond Lawson, Method’s 
“Green Giant” (or director of sustainability) seconded that notion. Method’s 
strategy was to hire creative people and then get out of their way. In the case of 
Holzhauer, Lawson said:
He has this opportunity to really play with everything in the lab, bring it 
through, and get some prototypes up to the point where we can take them 
and put them in other people’s hands. Whereas if we mandate—go make this 
formulation with these characteristics—he’d be checked out and bored and 
gone. You’d end up with what you ask for instead of myriad opportunities.
10
Method’s green chefs decided to build upon the success of Method’s three-
times-concentrated detergent. Further concentration would decrease the water 
in the product, thereby decreasing volume, mass, packaging, storage space, and 
freight costs. Method also wanted to encapsulate the detergent in tablet form for 
the user’s convenience and to reduce detergent wasted by inaccurate measure-
ment. The green chefs listed their goals and all the tools at their disposal, includ-
ing the conventional harsh, artificial tools. They focused initially on getting the 
detergent formula right. As Holzhauer explained:
The first thing you do is you build it the old way. You build it with all the 
nasty stuff that a competitor would and say, “What would be the highest per-
forming biggest-payoff thing that we could build?” And you build it and then 
you say, “This stuff rocks. This is my benchmark. How close can I get using 
materials that are available with green?” Then there’s the whole process of draw-
ing lines through a whole bunch of stuff you wish you could use. And you’re left 
with some holes. You’re definitely left with some holes.
11
Method, in collaboration with the Environmental Protection Encouragement 
Agency based in Hamburg, Germany, had amassed a list of safe, biodegradable 
chemicals to use as starting points for its products. Holzhauer had to ensure no 
unwanted interactions among those ingredients, but he also had to fill the holes 
in his toolkit in order to get the results he wanted. Method prized its products’ 
effectiveness above all else. If the products didn’t clean, it didn’t matter that they 
were natural, nontoxic, and beautiful. But other constraints aside from perfor-
mance, rather than limiting Method, forced the company to be more innovative.
Lowry had once called tradeoffs among these various qualities “just a symp-
tom of poor design.” In addition, Lowry considered the following to be essential:
. . .to make sure that what you’re doing is really compelling for reasons 
other than being green. It has to be great in its own right, and green has to

be just another part of its quality. The whole idea of eco-entrepreneur should 
become the standard for entrepreneurship in genera1.12
Therefore, the chefs pushed further. They began to consult their networks. 
Holzhauer said:
This is where collaboration and innovation really pay off. You start asking 
people who make detergents, [who] know you’re handy, and you leverage 
your relationships and you say, “Hey, would you guys entertain this thought? 
You guys can make sodium laurel sulfate, but nobody’s making MIPA sulfate, 
and that’s the kind of tool that would really make a difference in what I’m 
doing, and it’s just not available commercially. How about you whip me up 
a lab sample, you know?” And [from that] you get a new tool and you try it.
The chefs continued to use their contacts, get new tools, and test and alter 
them. They eventually refined the formula, dubbed “smartclean,” to be as effec-
tive as “the nasty stuff’ yet naturally based and eight times as concentrated. They 
found their detergent showed nonlinear improvement; doubling the concentra-
tion more than doubled its effectiveness.
Unexpectedly, they had moved into a new realm of chemistry in which few 
people had any experience working with such concentrated liquids. They kept 
testing the formula until they understood at the molecular level what exactly was 
happening (Exhibit 1). They also realized that the increased effectiveness meant 
they needed far less of the detergent to do the job, which meant the product 
could now compete on cost.
13
The gel capsule, however, continued to be a problem. Holzhauer talked to 
people in the paintball industry to get a sense of how big he could make a glycerin 
or gelatin capsule to hold the detergent. He wanted something that could fit in 
your hand, and the paintball people thought that could be done. Holzhauer con-
centrated the detergent enough so the capsule size would contain all the detergent 
needed. Yet the detergent was so effective that it dissolved the capsules as well 
unless they were made sufficiently thick, at which point they would not fully dis-
solve in cold-water wash conditions. Holzhauer tinkered with the formula. He 
knew petroleum-based and animal-derived ingredients could make it all work per-
fectly, but that violated Method’s premise of sustainability and ethics. “We tried 
and tried and tried. We just never got where we wanted to go,” Holzhauer said.
Surviving Failure: Collaboration and the Container
Ever optimistic that a tablet/capsule solution would be found, the chefs still 
wanted to test the “smartclean” detergent itself. They thought of a diaper cream

APPENDIX    Cases512
Method already sold and got a simple idea: Put the detergent in the pump dis-
penser used for the diaper cream. Let people squirt the detergent straight into the 
washing machine instead of dissolving a tablet. Suddenly, the critical solution 
had taken hold in the chef group: a pump, not a tablet for this detergent. Hol-
zhauer talked with Josh Handy to refine the pump bottle further. “If you get a 
bright idea,” Holzhauer said, “you walk over to Josh’s desk and you say, ‘Hey, 
dude. I need one of these. Could you whip it up for me?’ And he’s like, ‘Sure.’ 
He’ll ask a few questions about it and make sure it’s worth the time, but he’ll do 
it.” Handy began working on Holzhauer’s pump and posted his drawings out-
side the bathroom so that employees from all over could see them and provide 
feedback.
The switch from gel tablet to pump sent Holzhauer back to the lab to refine 
the formula. The detergent was incredibly viscous and had to be tweaked to 
work in a pump. It also had to be uniformly mixed so that each squirt dispensed 
exactly the same proportion of ingredients, whereas in the tablet the ingredi-
ents would all mix eventually once the tablet dissolved and thus could start off 
unevenly dispersed. Holzhauer wanted to keep tweaking the formula, which he 
had already gotten to 95% effectiveness using all benign and renewable ingre-
dients, but Method was preparing to launch the product. Holzhauer patented his 
work to date and continued to work on a revised version for future release.
The new detergent formula appeared to work in the pump, so Method 
shifted emphasis to making sure it could get exactly the container it needed. 
Handy’s final design featured a pump mechanism that was easy to depress with-
out Herculean strength (Exhibit 2 and Exhibit 3). A standard cap and bottle 
made measurement a two-handed task. In contrast, Method’s customer could 
hold a laundry basket or child in one arm and dispense the necessary smartclean 
detergent—four short squirts—with the other hand. Whereas a full bottle of typi-
cal two-times concentrate could easily weigh seven pounds or more, Method’s 
50-load smartclean container, when full, weighed less than two pounds.
Handy’s design next had to be mass-produced. That task fell largely to the 
packaging engineering and project management teams. Collaboration was the 
key for these groups; said one packaging engineer: “I can literally turn my chair 
around and help contribute.” Method employees worked at common long tables, 
rather than in cubicles, so they could overhear discussions and add to them. The 
project manager believed innovation was more important than strict adherence 
to procedures. The packaging engineers, known internally as plastic surgeons, 
found they could use a stock engine (the internal workings of the pump) for the 
detergent but needed a custom top to match Method’s aesthetic and operating 
needs. They reached out to various suppliers and found only one willing to col-
laborate on the custom design. Method agreed to pay for the tooling necessary 
to produce the top.
Method wanted the bottle itself to have transparent windows to show the 
contents and the newly designed angled dip tube that sucked in the detergent. 
That transparency would allow customers to ensure the tube always rested at

the bottom of the container to extract all the detergent rather than leave some 
behind. Method selected an independent, California-based plastics manufacturer 
that produced almost 200 million containers annually and had experience using 
post-consumer recycled number-two plastic (HDPE). Method pushed the recy-
cled content as high as it could before it started sacrificing transparency. Hence, 
the company ultimately settled on 50% virgin HDPE and 50% PCR HDPE.
Simultaneously, Method worked to produce the detergent in sufficient vol-
ume. Method’s operations department began working with the contract manu-
facturer it selected to make the product, a supplier for almost all the biggest 
personal care and cleaner companies, including P&G, Unilever, and others. 
Method’s ops team ushered the smartclean detergent from batches in Method’s 
labs to identical, but much more massive, batches in the factory. A pilot manu-
facturing run revealed new problems—and a new opportunity. The first factory 
batch was contaminated by dirt from the bottling equipment because the Method 
detergent was so powerful, it cleaned out the lines as it moved through the sys-
tem. Although Method had to nix the batch, it stumbled into a potential market: 
industrial cleaners. Indeed, the manufacturer began using the smartclean laundry 
detergent as its default factory equipment cleaner.
Finally, Method needed new shrink-wrapping equipment to put a label around 
the bottle’s unique shape and to keep the pump locked even while allowing cus-
tomers to unscrew the cap and sniff the detergent, a design requirement respond-
ing to the desire of many buyers to smell the contents. Method worked with the 
manufacturer to get the results it needed and invested in the new equipment.
Quantifying Sustainability
Moving through the development and production of the smartclean laundry 
detergent, Method wanted to assess the product’s environmental impact. The 
first step was Cradle-to-Cradle certification, which smartclean became the first 
laundry detergent ever to obtain. Smartclean also was recognized by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency’s Design for Environment program because 
of its nontoxic, biodegradable formulation.
In addition, Method wanted to calculate the detergent’s overall carbon foot-
print. It collaborated with Planet Metrics, a Silicon Valley start-up founded in 
2008 with $2.3 million in venture capital Series A funding. The young company 
was eager to collaborate with a company such as Method to build its reputation 
and beta-test its Rapid Carbon Modeling software. The ultimate goal of the soft-
ware was to give companies a quick way to calculate returns on investment for 
various sustainability options. It did so by measuring life-cycle carbon emissions 
from a product throughout Scopes 1, 2, and 3. Those scopes are defined by the 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol accounting method as follows:
 ■ Scope 1: all direct GHG emissions

purchased materials and fuels, transport-related activities in vehicles not 
owned or controlled by the reporting entity, electricity-related activities 
(e.g., transmission losses) not covered in Scope 2, outsourced activities, 
waste disposal, etc.

Planet Metrics analyzed Method’s detergent from cradle-to-gate: all the 
activities and material needed to produce the product and get it ready to ship to 
retailers. Of course, later carbon dioxide emissions would presumably be lower 
for shipment to retailers, recycling old bottles, and so on, because the bottles 
used less material overall, which meant less energy and less mass to be moved 
around for an equivalent cleaning capacity. Looking just at cradle-to-gate, 
however, Method’s smartclean detergent per load had a carbon footprint 35% 
smaller than the average two-times concentrated laundry detergent. It also used 
36% less plastic and 33% less oil and energy. Finally, consumers would be more 
likely to use the appropriate amount of detergent, making the actual reductions 
even greater.
Conclusion
Reflecting on the path of the smartclean laundry detergent, Lowry considered 
it a success born of failure. People were given space to create and collaborate 
within Method and across its supply chain. They didn’t shut down after encoun-
tering obstacles; they got more creative and talked to each other. Lowry noted 
some factory workers where the detergent was made volunteered to work extra, 
unpaid shifts because they believed they were part of something bigger: a social 
change, not just another way to make money off people’s dirty laundry. He said:
Cultures are the only sustainable competitive advantage. We don’t see the 
innovation per se as the competitive advantage. We see the ability to inno-
vate as the competitive advantage. If you’re going to do that you’ve got to 
build a different type of company where you literally are built—the people 
and the culture of the place—around the ability to bring the best ideas for-
ward and let them live and let them thrive. Each innovation gives us license 
to innovate again.
By summer 2010, it appeared the new laundry detergent was a successful 
launch. What was the next focus for this young, fast-moving company? Typical 
growth challenges faced the firm and its entrepreneurial founders. As it grew 
from start-up to midsize, could its innovative output be maintained? How should 
management’s attention be allocated across its innovation imperatives and its 
proliferation of product offerings and growth demands? And what was the end 
point? Was the goal to grow Method indefinitely?

Conventional Detergent Micelle
Detergents typically consisted of two parts: a tail that could stick to oils (and 
other grime) and a head that stuck to water, so the dirt could be rinsed away in 
the wash. This structure led detergent molecules to clump into spheres, called 
micelles, in water because the hydrophilic heads (circle) faced out, while the 
hydrophobic tails (line), consisting of chemicals similar to fat, faced in.
Conventional detergents worked by breaking open the micelles in the wash-
ing machines so the tails could grab dirt and then getting the micelles to clump 
with the dirt in the middle so it could be washed away in the water. Breaking 
open micelles required agitation and thermal energy.
Method’s smartclean laundry detergent kept hydrophobic tails on the outside, 
available to interact with dirt immediately. This inverted micelle made the detergent 
more efficient: Cleaning was improved while less detergent was wasted because it 
interacted more readily with dirt and less energy was needed to agitate and heat 
the laundry. This inverted property also reduced the amount of water needed in the 
liquid, thereby concentrating the detergent and reducing its mass and volume.

BIODIESEL INCORPORATED
Joshua Maxwell shut down his laptop and looked out the window. From the 
second floor of the Graduate School of Management’s new building, he could 
see a number of cars driving on the nearby freeway and sitting in the adjacent 
parking lot.
Josh was in his last term of the full-time MBA program at UC Davis. He 
would soon be graduating and entering a new chapter of his life. While he had 
the luxury of having several management-level job offers from which to choose, 
he was unsure whether he wanted to follow such a traditional route. There was 
one opportunity in particular that had recently come across his path which gave 
him pause.
Background
The previous term, Josh had been enrolled in Professor Dorf’s class on Business 
and Sustainability. While the class was offered at the GSM, it was open to the 
entire university. In this class, he met Hannah Long, who was in her final year of 
her undergraduate studies in Agricultural Economics, and Matthew Hammond, 
who was a senior in the Mechanical Engineering department.
The three began working on a class project, which would ultimately turn 
into a formidable business opportunity. The impetus for their collaboration 
began with a lecture-discussion regarding the challenges and opportunities in the 
emerging renewable energy industry.
The Challenge
Dependence on energy is a worldwide reality. Energy powers the machines and 
equipment around us in order to make life more convenient and efficient. In our 
everyday lives, energy is synonymous with the forms that it can assume. The 
major generation sources—petroleum, coal, natural gas and nuclear—are non-
renewable resources and have detrimental effects on the environment. In our daily 
lives, the two most common forms of this energy are liquid fuel (refined from 
petroleum) and electricity.
1
Increasingly, developed and developing countries alike are consuming liquid 
fuel for the purposes of mobility, food production, and the facilitation of trade. 
All of these functions essentially provide a substitute for human effort. Due to 
the widespread consumption of petrol-based liquid fuel, an incredibly large global 
infrastructure and set of surrounding institutions have grown around the support of 
such consumption. The petrochemical fuel industry manifests itself in the form of 
oil fields and reserves, pipelines, transport ships, and fueling stations.
Prepared by MBA candidate Benjamin Finkelor; Assistance from MBA candidate Sonja Yates and Paul 
Yu-Yang under the supervision of Professor Richard C. Dorf, Graduate School of Management of UC 
Davis.
1 Technically speaking, liquid fuel is a form of energy, and electricity is considered a carrier of energy.
For the purposes of this proposal, the distinction is not significant.

The way energy is used worldwide is not sustainable. It is well-documented 
that the use of these fuels is depleting the world’s natural resource reserves, harming 
communities in terms of health and displacement, and polluting the air and water 
in local environments. The drilling, refining, and transporting of oil leads to spills 
on land and in oceans, and when petrol-based fuels are used to power machines and 
automobiles, the air is polluted with greenhouse gases and particulate matter such 
as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur, and nitrous oxide emissions.
In spite of the drawbacks, the current energy industry is committed to the 
continuation of these ways, primarily because of considerable assets and invest-
ment in the existing form of infrastructure.
The challenge, which became clear to the team from class discussion and 
further brainstorming, is to find a form of fuel or technology that can mitigate 
the current negative affects on the environment of petrol-based fuel while uti-
lizing the existing infrastructure. The urgency of this challenge is heightened 
by the astounding projected growth in the global population and per-capita 
 consumption of liquid fuels.
The Concept
Matthew’s coursework in engineering coupled with a bit of networking with 
fellow engineers suggested the emerging technology of biodiesel as a possible 
solution to this challenge. As the group explored the environmental benefits and 
the viability of the diesel fuel substitute, the three began to realize the potential 
of the biodiesel market.
Biodiesel is a vegetable- and/or animal-based product that serves as a sub-
stitute for traditional diesel fuel. Although its chemical composition is dissimilar 
from the petrol-based diesel, biodiesel will still work in diesel engines built in 
and after 1996 with no modification. For engines made before that time, modi-
fications can be made to allow for the use of biodiesel fuel. The choice of bio-
diesel as a product of biomass is an intentional one. Producing a product that can 
be utilized by the existing infrastructure and social patterns of use
2 increases the 
likelihood of its adoption. “Entrepreneurs must locate their ideas within the set of 
existing understandings and actions that constitute the institutional environment 
yet set their innovations apart from what already exists.”
3 This economic viability 
is coupled with a significant potential to the environment: biodiesel showcases an 
innovation that is a step in the right direction for air quality.
Biodiesel’s greatest promise to sustainability as a renewable energy source 
is its lower emissions over conventional diesel. Compared to traditional diesel, 
biodiesel achieves significant reductions in harmful emissions. Additionally, the 
ozone-forming impact of biodiesel is nearly half of that of petroleum fuel. Fur-
ther benefits can be counted when looking at lifecycle effects. If biodiesel is

obtained using soybeans as an example, the amount of CO2 taken up by soybeans 
and released upon burning the fuel, is a near zero sum balance. Contrast this with 
petroleum products where release of CO2 is unidirectional into the atmosphere.
Because biodiesel is biodegradable and dependent on organic material as 
opposed to fossil fuels, the energy source is considered renewable. Production of 
biodiesel begins with feedstock, preferably in the form of oils or fats. Oils can be 
processed from oleic varieties of plants such as soy, canula, sunflower and saf-
flower. Fats can come directly from grease such as and tallow/lard and recycled 
cooking grease from restaurants. The oils or fats are mixed with alcohol and a 
catalyst in a process that forms esters resulting in biodiesel defined as mono-
alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids and glycerin.
Ultimately, the large-scale production of biodiesel would generate a dra-
matic impact on the economic value of the feedstocks involved. For example, 
according to one study, if biodiesel demand over the next ten years were to 
increase to 200 million gallons, a commensurate amount of soy oil would be 
required and net average farm income would increase by $300 million per year. 
A bushel of soybeans would increase by an average of 17 cents over the ten-year 
period.
4 The potential economic benefit to farmers seems considerable.
Even with such economies of scale, however, the wholesale price of 
100 percent biodiesel would rarely be lower, and therefore cost-competitive, 
with traditional diesel fuel. Barring some crisis that would drive up the price of 
crude oil or reduce the capacity of diesel refineries, the current regulatory struc-
ture and assets devoted to petrol-diesel will more often than not yield a lower 
price with petrol-based diesel. Biodiesel as a fuel additive however, does pro-
vide a cost-competitive potential. Studies have shown that splash-mixing even 
1 percent biodiesel with traditional diesel “can increase the lubricity of petro-
leum diesel by up to 65 percent.”
5 This is not to mention the sulfur- and other 
emissions-reducing benefits that splash-mixing provides. As more consumer 
and regulatory pressure is placed on traditional diesel users, biodiesel produc-
ers will be able to charge the premium necessary to offset higher  relative costs. 
Markets for 100 percent biodiesel will grow as well in such specialty markets 
as the marine industry, railroads, electricity generators, and even agriculture.
Biodiesel Incorporated
Josh, Hannah, and Matthew presented a compelling business case for their final 
class project: Biodiesel Incorporated. This new venture would enlist and develop 
a series of local producer’s cooperatives in an effort to capitalize on the emerg-
ing biodiesel market as described in the following list:
 ■ Members would grow feedstock crops and gather crop residues with high 
fat content.

 ■ Capital equipment costs would be shared and spread over membership. 
Oils would be extracted from the collected biomass and biodiesel would be 
produced using these oils.
 ■ Biodiesel Incorporated would distribute the biodiesel locally using the 
existing petroleum-based infrastructure.
Advantages of the Cooperative Business Form
The cooperative model has been successfully used to allow small farmers to 
maintain a competitive edge against the larger corporate farming organizations. 
“Today, there are more than 4,000 agricultural cooperatives in the U.S., with a 
total net income of nearly $2 billion and net business volume of more than $89 
billion.”
6 A coop is owned and controlled by the members, with self-reliance and 
self-help being key characteristics—ideal for the implementation of emerging 
and disruptive innovations such as biodiesel.
Biodiesel Incorporated will:
 ■  Utilize the collective purchase power of the coop to obtain necessary 
 capital-intensive equipment and to gain economies of scale.
 ■ Increase negotiating power, allowing it to
  ■  Stabilize crop prices and biodiesel output
  ■  Gain access to higher-volume contracts
 ■ Serve to unite rural communities and preserve agricultural economy
Biodiesel Incorporated offers the unique service of both the bargaining and 
manufacturing of biodiesel on behalf of its farmer members. It will serve to 
control the production of agricultural products (i.e., the biomass feedstock), the 
price and terms set for members’ production, and price and terms for biodiesel 
output.

YAHOO!
Guess, three and a half years ago, if we were looking to start a  business and 
make a lot of money, we wouldn’t have done this.
—Jerry Yang, 1997
It was April of 1995—a key decision point for Jerry Yang and David Filo. These 
two Stanford School of Engineering graduate students were the founders of 
Yahoo!, the most popular Internet search site on the World Wide Web. Yang and 
Filo had decided that they could transform their Internet hobby into a viable busi-
ness. While trying to decide between several different financing and partnering 
options that were available to them, they attended a meeting with Michael Moritz, 
a partner at Sequoia Capital. Sequoia, one of the leading venture capital firms in 
Silicon Valley, had been discussing the possibility of investing in Yahoo!.
Michael Moritz leaned forward in his chair. As he looked across the confer-
ence table at Jerry and Dave, he laid out Sequoia’s offer to fund Yahoo!:
As you know, we have been working together on this for some time now. 
We have done a lot of hard work and research to come up with a fair value 
for Yahoo!, and we have decided on a $4 million valuation. We at Sequoia 
Capital are prepared to offer you $1 million in venture funding in exchange 
for a 25 percent share in your company. We think that with our help, you 
have a real chance to make Yahoo! something special. Our first order of 
business will be to help you assemble a complete management team, after 
which we should be able to really start helping you to develop and manage 
your site’s vast amount of content.
Right now, the biggest risk that you guys run is not making a decision. 
You have to make a decision, because if you don’t, someone else is going 
to run you over. You might get run over by Netscape. You might get run

over by AOL. You might get run over by one of these other venture-backed 
start-ups. It is imperative that you make a decision now if you are going to 
survive. To help you make a decision, I am going to give you a deadline: 
tomorrow. If you don’t want to do business with Sequoia, that’s OK. I’ll be 
disappointed, but that’s OK. But you are going to have to call me by 10 a.m. 
tomorrow morning to tell me yes or no.
1
Yang and Filo gazed around the Sequoia conference room and noticed the 
many posters of companies such as Cisco, Oracle, and Apple that were hung 
from the walls—all success stories from past Sequoia investments. They won-
dered if Yahoo!’s poster would someday join that group. The two were excited 
at the possibilities; however, they still had some decisions to make. There were 
several other financing options available, and they were still not sure if they 
wanted to accept Sequoia’s funding. Yang responded:
That sounds like a pretty fair offer, Mike. Let us talk this over tonight, and 
we will get back to you by tomorrow after we weigh all of our options. How-
ever you have to realize that we’re still grad students, and we don’t even 
usually wake up by 10 a.m., so can you give us until noon?
Yahoo!
Yahoo! was an Internet site that provided a hierarchically organized list of 
links to sites on the World Wide Web. It offered a way for the general public to 
easily navigate and explore the Web. Users could click through multiple topic and 
category headings until they found a list of direct links to Web sites related to their 
interest. In addition, Yahoo! offered a central place where people could go to just 
to see what was out there. This made it easy for people with little previous expo-
sure to the Web to start searching through Yahoo!’s lists of links, often just to see 
if they could find something of interest. In a little over a year since its inception, it 
had become one of the most heavily visited sites on the Web.
But Yang and Filo believed Yahoo! had the potential to be much more than 
a way for Web surfers to find what they were looking for. In 1995, John Taysom, 
a vice president of marketing of Reuters, a London-based provider of news and 
financial data, called Jerry Yang to explore the idea of a Yahoo!-Reuters part-
nership. It seemed to Taysom that affiliating with Yahoo! could help Reuters to 
build a distribution network on the Web.
“The first thing Jerry said to me,” Taysom remembers, “was ‘if you hadn’t 
called me, I would have called you.’” Jerry got the news feed vision. He had 
been thinking about it for months. He further surprised Taysom by inform-
ing him that as far as he was concerned, Yahoo! was “not just a directory but 
a media property.”

Yang further believed that: “Primarily we’re a brand. We’re trying to pro-
mote the brand and build the product so that it has reliability, pizzazz, and cred-
ibility. The focus of the business deals we are doing right now is not on revenues 
but on our brand.”

Dave and Jerry at Stanford
David Filo, a native of Moss Bluff, Louisiana, attended Tulane University’s 
undergraduate program in computer engineering. In 1988, Filo finished his 
undergraduate work and enrolled in Stanford’s master’s program in electrical 
engineering. Completing his master’s degree, he opted to stay at Stanford and 
try for his PhD in electrical engineering. Extremely competent in the technical 
arena, Filo had been described by many as a quiet and reserved individual.
Jerry Yang was a Taiwanese native who moved to California at the age of 
10. Yang was raised by his widowed mother and grew up in San Jose with his 
younger brother, Ken. Yang was a member of the Stanford class of 1990 and 
completed both his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering. 
Yang also opted to stay at Stanford for a PhD in electrical engineering. Also 
technically competent, Yang was considered much more outgoing than Filo.
Yang and Filo met each other in the electrical engineering department at 
Stanford; Filo was Yang’s teaching assistant for one of his classes. They also 
both worked in the same design automation software research group. They 
became close friends while teaching at the Stanford campus in Kyoto, Japan. 
Upon returning to the Stanford campus, they moved into adjacent cubicles in 
the same trailer to conduct their graduate research. They both enjoyed working 
together, as their individual personalities perfectly complemented each other, 
forming a unique combination.
Their office was not much to look at, but it served as a place for them to 
work on their research as well as a place from which they could run their web-
site. “The launching pad (for Yahoo!) was an oxygen-depleted, double-wide 
trailer, stocked by the university with computer workstations and by the students 
with life’s necessities . . . that prompted a friend to call the scene ‘a cockroach’s 
picture of Christmas’.”
4 Michael Moritz remembered his early visits to Jerry and 
Dave’s cube:
With the shades drawn tight, the Sun servers generating a ferocious amount 
of heat, the answering machine going on and off every couple of minutes, 
golf clubs stashed against the walls, pizza cartons on the floor, and unwashed 
clothes strewn around . . . it was every mother’s idea of the bedroom she 
wished her sons never had.

Mosaic and the World Wide Web
In 1993, the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign’s National Center for 
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) revolutionized the growth and popular-
ity of the World Wide Web by introducing a Web browser they had developed 
called Mosaic. Mosaic made the Web “an ideal distribution vehicle for all kinds 
of information in the professional and academic circles in which it was known.”
6 
It provided an easy-to-use graphical interface that allowed users to travel from 
site to site simply by clicking on specified links. This led to the widespread prac-
tice of surfing the Web, as people spent hours trying to find new and interesting 
sites. This easy-to-use browser for navigating the Internet was estimated to have 
2 million users worldwide in just over one year.
Creating Jerry’s Guide to the World Wide Web
With Mosaic’s introduction in late 1993, Filo and Yang, along with thousands 
of other students, began devoting large amounts of time to surfing the Web and 
exploring the vast content available. As they discovered interesting sites, they 
made bookmarks of the sites. The Mosaic Web browser had an option to store a 
bookmark list of your favorite sites. This feature allowed users to return directly 
to a page that they had visited, without having to navigate through several differ-
ent links. As the popularity of the Web quickly increased, so did the total num-
ber of sites created, which in turn led to an increase in the number of interesting 
sites that Filo and Yang wanted to bookmark. Eventually, their personal list of 
favorite Web sites grew large and unwieldy, due to the fact that the earliest ver-
sions of Mosaic were unable to sort bookmarks in any convenient manner.
To address this problem, Filo and Yang wrote software using Tcl/TK and 
Perl scripts that allowed them to group their bookmarks into subject areas. They 
named their list of sites “Jerry’s Guide to the World Wide Web” and developed a 
Web interface for their list. People from all over the world started sending Jerry 
and Dave e-mail, saying how much they appreciated the effort. Yang explained: 
“We just wanted to avoid doing our dissertations.”
7
The two set out to cover the entire Web. They tried to visit and categorize 
at least 1,000 sites a day. When a subject category grew too large, subcategories 
were created, and then sub-subcategories. The hierarchy made it easy for even 
novices to find websites quickly. “Jerry’s Guide” was a labor of love—lots of 
labor, since no software program could evaluate and categorize sites. Filo per-
suaded Yang to resist the engineer’s first impulse to try to automate the process. 
“No technology could beat human filtering,” Filo argued.

APPENDIX    Cases526
Though engineers, Yang and Filo had a great sense of what real people 
wanted. Consider their choice of name. Jerry hated “Jerry’s Guide,” so he and 
Filo opted for “Yahoo!,” a memorable parody of the tech community’s obses-
sion with acronyms (this one stood for “Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Ora-
cle”). Why the exclamation point? Said Yang: “Pure marketing hype.”
9
Yahoo!’s Growing Popularity
At first, Yahoo! was only accessible by the two engineering students. Even-
tually, they created a Web interface that allowed other people access to their 
guide. As knowledge of Yahoo!’s existence spread by word of mouth and e-mail, 
more people began using their site, and Yahoo!’s network resource requirements 
increased exponentially. Stanford provided them with sufficient bandwidth to 
the Internet, but bottlenecks came from limitations in the number of TCP/IP con-
nections that could be made to the two students’ workstations.
10 Additionally, 
the time required to maintain the site was becoming unmanageable, as Yang 
and Filo found themselves continually updating their Web site with new links. 
Classes and research fell behind as Yang and Filo devoted more and more time 
to their ever-expanding hobby.
Competing Services
A number of businesses already existed in the Internet search space. While none 
offered the same service that Yahoo! did, these companies could definitely pro-
vide potential competition to any new business that Yahoo! would start. Among 
the competitors were Architext, soon to be renamed Excite, Webcrawler at the 
University of Washington, Lycos at Carnegie Mellon, the World Wide Web 
Worm, and Infoseek, founded by Steven Kirsh. AOL and Microsoft in 1995 rep-
resented larger competitors who could enter the market either by building their own 
capability or acquiring one of the other start-ups.
Yahoo!’s human-crafted hierarchical approach to organizing the information 
for intuitive searches was a key component of its value proposition. Rob Reid, a 
Venture Capitalist with 21st Century Internet Venture Partners, explained how 
this made Yahoo! unique among Internet search providers.
The Yahoo! hierarchy is a handcrafted tool in that all of its . . . categories 
were designated by people, not computers. The sites that they link to are 
likewise deliberately chosen, not assigned by software algorithms. In this, 
Yahoo! is a very labor intensive product. But it is also a guide with human 
discretion and judgment built into it—and this can at times make it almost 
uncannily effective. . . .

  Yahoo! 527
This is the essence of Yahoo!’s uniqueness and (let’s say it) genius. 
It isn’t especially interesting to point to information that many people are 
known to find interesting. TV Guide does this. So do phone books, and 
countless Web sites that cater to well-defined interest groups. . . . But 
Yahoo! is able to build intuitive paths that might be singularly, or even tem-
porarily important to the people seeking it. And it does this in a way that no 
other service has truly replicated.
11
However, if Yahoo!, as a business, was to survive and flourish in the face 
of increasingly well-funded competition, it would quickly need to find some 
outside capital.
Leaving Stanford and Starting the Business
Yang and Filo had been in Silicon Valley long enough to realize that what they 
really wanted to do was to start their own business. They split much of their free 
time between their Internet hobby and sitting around thinking up possible busi-
ness ideas.
“A considerable period of time passed before it occurred to them that the 
most promising idea was sitting under their noses, and some of the credit for 
their eventual illumination belongs to their PhD adviser, Giovanni De Micheli. 
Toward the end of 1994, De Micheli noted that inquiries to Yahoo! were rising 
at an alarming rate. In a single month, the number of hits jumped from thou-
sands to hundreds of thousands daily. With their workstations maxed out, and 
the university’s computer system beginning to feel the load, De Micheli told 
them that they would have to move their hobby off campus if they wanted to 
keep it going.”
12
By fall of 1994, the two received over two million hits a day on their site. It 
was then that Jerry and Dave commenced the search for outside backing to help 
them continue to build up Yahoo!, but with only modest hopes. Yang thought 
they might be able to bootstrap a workable system, using personal savings to buy 
a computer and negotiating the use of a network and a Web server in return for 
thank-you banners. Unexpected overtures from AOL and Netscape caused them 
to raise their sights, although both companies wanted to turn Filo and Yang into 
employees.
If they were going to abandon their academic careers (as they soon did, six 
months shy of their doctorates), they reasoned that they should hold out for some 
control. Filo and Yang had three main potential options to explore: (1) sell Yahoo! 
outright; (2) partner with a corporate sponsor; (3) start an independent business 
using venture capital financing.

APPENDIX    Cases528
The Search for Funding
Looking to receive funding and create a credible business out of Yahoo!, Filo 
and Yang began preliminary discussions with potential partners in October 
1994. One of the first people who contacted them was John Taysom, a vice-
president of marketing at Reuters, the London-based media service. Taysom 
was interested in integrating Reuters’ news service into Yahoo!’s Web pages. 
Yahoo! would gain the advantage of being able to provide news services from 
a well-known source, while Reuters would be able to begin developing its own 
presence on the Internet. Unfortunately, since Yahoo! did not generate revenues, 
it was in a poor negotiating position. Talks between the two were cordial, but 
they also progressed very slowly.
Yahoo! also talked to Randy Adams, founder of the Internet Shopping 
Network (ISN), a company that styled itself as “the first online retailer in the 
world.” ISN, funded by Draper Fisher Jurvetson, was one of the first venture 
funded Internet companies. It had recently been purchased by the Home Shop-
ping Network, in order to expand its possible exposure. ISN was interested in 
being a host site for Yahoo!, offering them the chance to finally generate some 
revenue. However, there were also definite possible disadvantages that came 
from being associated with a shopping network.
Another company that approached Yahoo! was Netscape Communications 
Corporation. Founded in April 1994 by Jim Clark, who also founded Silicon 
Graphics, and Marc Andressen, who created the NCSA Mosaic browser with 
a team of other UIUC students and staff, Netscape was a hot private com-
pany developing an improved browser based on the old Mosaic technology. 
Andressen contacted Yang and Filo over e-mail and, in Yang’s words said, 
“Well, I heard you guys were looking for some space. Why don’t you come on 
into the Netscape network? We’ll host you for free and you can give us some 
recognition for it.”
13 This was a fortuitous contact that allowed Yahoo! to move 
itself off of Stanford’s campus. By early 1995, Yahoo! was running on four 
Netscape workstations.
Soon after, Netscape offered to purchase Yahoo! outright in exchange for 
Netscape stock. The advantage of this option was that Netscape was already 
planning its initial public offering and had tremendous publicity and momen-
tum behind it. Coupled with high profile founders and backers like Clark, James 
Barksdale, former president and CEO of AT&T Wireless Services, and the ven-
ture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, this offer was a potentially 
lucrative one for the two Yahoo! founders. Additionally, Netscape’s company 
culture was more in tune with what the two students were looking for, in com-
parison to some of the more established market players.

  Yahoo! 529
Corporate Partnerships
Yahoo! was also feeling tremendous pressure to partner or accept corporate 
sponsorship from other large content companies and online service providers like 
America Online (AOL), Prodigy, and Compuserve. These companies offered 
the carrot of money, stock, and/or possible management positions. They argued 
that if Yahoo! did not partner with them, as large players they could develop 
their own competing services that would cause Yahoo! to fail. One potential 
disadvantage with corporate funding was the potential taint that came with such 
sponsorship. Yahoo! had started as a grass-roots effort, free of commercializa-
tion. A second disadvantage was the lack of control that the two Yahoo! founders 
would have over their creation. “Building Yahoo! was fun, particularly without 
adult supervision. (Dave) and Jerry were also worried that selling to AOL would 
have ‘most likely killed’ Yahoo! in the end.”
14
With partner discussions beginning to heat up, Yang requested help from Tim 
Brady, a friend and second-year Harvard Business School student. As a class proj-
ect, Brady generated a business plan for Yahoo! during the 1994–1995 Christmas 
vacation. (See the Appendix for excerpts of the business plan circa 1995.)
With Brady’s business plan in hand, Filo and Yang began to approach dif-
ferent venture capital firms on nearby Sand Hill Road. Venture capital firms 
brought experience, valuable contacts in the Silicon Valley, and most impor-
tantly, money. However, they also required substantial ownership in return 
for their services. One venture firm that the Yahoo! founders approached was 
Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. KPCB had an excellent reputation as one of 
the most prestigious VC firms in the Silicon Valley, and their list of successful 
investments included Sun Microsystems and Netscape. KPCB showed a defi-
nite interest in Yahoo!; however, Vinod Khosla of KPCB and Geoffrey Yang 
of Institutional Venture Partners had just invested $0.5M in Architext (later 
renamed Excite), another company started by Stanford engineering students 
that was developing a search-and-retrieval text engine. Architext was receiv-
ing increased press coverage, with a March 1995 Red Herring magazine spot-
lighting the company and its venture capital partners. KPCB proposed to fund 
Yahoo!, but only if they agreed to merge with Architext.
Sequoia Capital
Another venture capital firm that Yahoo! approached was Sequoia Capital. It 
was during partnership discussions with Adams at the Internet Shopping Net-
work that Yang and Filo were first introduced to Michael Moritz, a partner at 
Sequoia Capital. Moritz went to visit Jerry and Dave, who were at the time 
still operating out of their tiny Stanford trailer. Said Yang, “The first time we 
sat down with Sequoia, Mike (Moritz) asked, ‘So, how much are you going to 
charge subscribers?’ Dave and I looked at each other and said, ‘Well, it’s going

to be a long conversation.”15 Fortunately, Moritz, who came from a journalistic 
background at Time was flexible in his thinking. Some of the major advantages 
that Moritz brought to the negotiating table were his contacts with publications 
and knowledge about how to manage content. Moritz talked about the roots of 
Sequoia’s interest in working with Yang and Filo. “I think we are always enam-
ored with people that seem to be on to something, even if they can’t define that 
something. They had a real passion and a real spark.”
16
Sequoia Capital had a long tradition of success in the venture capital mar-
ket, citing that the total market capitalization for Sequoia backed companies 
exceeded that of any other venture capital firm. Sequoia’s trademark modus ope-
randi was funding successful companies using only a small amount of  capital. 
Its list of successful investments included Apple Computer, Oracle, Electronic 
Arts, Cisco Systems, Atari, and LSI Logic. Said Moritz, Sequoia preferred 
“to start wicked infernos with a single match rather than 10 million gallons of 
kerosene.”
17
In February 1995, Filo and Yang were weighing a number of possibilities 
and in no hurry to accept any of them, when Michael Moritz made them an offer. 
Sequoia Capital would fund Yahoo! for $1 million and would help them to assem-
ble a top management team. In return, Sequoia would receive a 25 percent share 
of the company. Additionally, Moritz gave them only 24 hours to accept the deal 
before it was pulled off the table. “I felt a need to deliver them from the agony 
of indecision,” claimed Moritz. With the deadline quickly approaching, Yang 
and Filo sat down to weigh their options. The decisions that they made that night 
would determine the direction of their careers as well and the future of Yahoo!
The Decision
Sitting in their tiny office on the Stanford campus, Jerry and Dave shared a late-
night pepperoni and mushroom pizza as they explored their options and tried 
to come to a decision. It was already getting pretty late, and they only had until 
noon the next day to make their decision.
Yang took a bite from his pizza as he looked over the terms sheet that 
Sequoia had given them.
We have some pretty tough decisions to make, and Michael has really forced 
the issue now with this 24-hour deadline. As I see it, we have a couple of 
options. The first is to accept Sequoia’s offer and launch Yahoo! as our own 
company. We would be giving up a significant percentage of Yahoo!, but 
we really need the money if we are going to survive. Moritz and the rest 
of the resources at Sequoia could also prove to be invaluable as we try to 
assemble the rest of our management team.

  Yahoo! 531
Our second option is to accept corporate sponsorship. This would allow 
us to get the funding we need and still retain 100 percent ownership of 
Yahoo!. However, I am worried about selling out to corporate America. We 
were fortunate to be able to develop our site in an educational setting as a 
noncommercial free site. I am afraid if we accept the corporate sponsorship, 
it will taint Yahoo!’s image.
Finally, we could agree to merge with an existing corporation. The 
word is that Netscape is pretty close to their IPO, and Architext has some 
really big time investors behind it. If we merge with Netscape or Architext 
in exchange for stock options, it could mean a lot of money for us in the next 
couple of years.
Filo got up from his seat and kicked aside some of the empty pizza 
boxes that had started to accumulate. He walked over to Yahoo!’s tiny 
office window and stared at Stanford’s Hoover Tower, which was barely 
visible in the distance.
It’s true that we could make some money if we sell to Netscape or 
Architext, but we would have to give up primary control of Yahoo! if we 
did. We would never know what we could have done if we would have 
maintained control of the site ourselves.
There is also a fourth option you forgot to mention. I’m excited by 
Sequoia’s offer, but I’m wondering if maybe we are giving up too much 
of our company. A fourth option could be to not decide tonight and look 
for better terms with another VC firm. I know Michael said that we should 
decide quickly, but I would hate to give up 25 percent of our company, only 
to find out in a week that another firm would have offered us $3 million for 
the same percentage. I know that time is really important, and we like work-
ing with Michael Moritz. On the other hand, I don’t want to be regretting 
our decision two months from now.
As they grappled with the alternatives facing them, Filo and Yang began to 
envision life outside of the Stanford trailer in which Yahoo! was born. It was 
well past 2 a.m., and they had to make a decision in less that ten hours. What 
should they do?
Questions
 1. What makes Yahoo! an attractive opportunity (and not just a good idea)?
 2. How will Yahoo! make money (i.e., business model)?
 3. Identify the major risks in each of these categories: technology, market, 
team, and financial. Rank order them.
 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of the funding options 
they could pursue? Which one do you recommend?

APPENDIX    Cases532
EXHIBIT 1 Yahoo! Founders and Potential Investor
Jerry Yang
Jerry Yang was a Taiwanese native who was raised in San Jose, California. 
He co-created the Yahoo! online guide in April of 1994. Jerry took a leave of 
absence from Stanford University’s electrical engineering PhD program after 
earning both his BS and MS degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford 
University.
David Filo
David Filo, a native from Moss Bluff, Louisiana, co-created the Yahoo! online 
guide in April 1994 and took a leave of absence from Stanford University’s 
electrical engineering PhD program in April 1995 to co-found Yahoo!, Inc. Filo 
received a BS degree in computer engineering from Tulane University and a MS 
degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University.
Michael Moritz, Partner, Sequoia Capital
Moritz was a general partner at Sequoia Capital since 1988 and focused on 
information technology investments. Moritz served as a director of Flextron-
ics International and Global Village Communication, as well as several private 
companies. Between 1979 and 1984, Moritz was employed in a variety of posi-
tions by Time, Inc. Moritz had an MA degree in history from Oxford University 
and an MBA from the Wharton School.
Appendix Selected Excerpts from the Yahoo! Business Plan.
Yahoo!’s first business plan was developed by Tim Brady as part of a course 
project at the Harvard Business School. The plan was continuing to evolve dur-
ing discussions between Jerry Yang and David Filo at Yahoo! and Michael 
Moritz of Sequoia Capital. For this case, the company has provided excerpts of 
this business plan that are not proprietary.
The case writers thank Mr. J. J. Healy, director of corporate development, 
and others at Yahoo! for their efforts in providing this original archival informa-
tion to enhance the learning experience of future entrepreneurs.
Business Strategy
Yahoo!’s goal is to remain the most popular and widely used guide to informa-
tion on the Internet. The Internet is in a period of market development char-
acterized by extremely high rates of both user traffic growth and entry of new 
companies focused on various products and services. By virtue of its early entry, 
Yahoo! has developed its current position as the leader in this segment. Yahoo!’s 
ability to expand its position and develop long-term, sustainable advantages will 
depend on a number of things. Some of these relate to its current position and 
others relate to its future strategy.
Today, Yahoo! solves the main problem facing all Internet users. It is next 
to impossible for users, faced with millions of pieces of information scattered

  Yahoo! 533
globally on the Internet, to easily find that what is relevant to them without a 
guide like Yahoo! Not only is the amount of information huge, it is expanding 
almost exponentially.
All enhancements to Yahoo! will be governed by the goal of making useful 
information easy to find for individuals.
We believe that Yahoo’s enormous following has been generated by the 
following list:
 ■ Yahoo! was the first company to create a fast, comprehensive and enjoy-
able guide to the Internet, and in so doing, built a strong brand early and 
created momentum.
 ■ The unique interest-area based structure of Yahoo! makes it an easier and 
more enjoyable way for the user to find relevant information than the clas-
sic search engine approach where key words and phrases are used as the 
starting point.
 ■ Through its editorial efforts, Yahoo! has continually built a guide which 
is noticeably better than its competition through a combination of 
 comprehensiveness and high quality.
The company will focus on the directory and the guide business and gener-
ate revenue from advertising and sponsorship.
Yahoo!’s strategy is to:
 ■ Continue to build user traffic and brand strength on the primary server 
site through product enhancements and extensions as well as through an 
aggressive marketing communications program.
 ■ Develop and integrate the leading technology required to maintain 
a leadership position. Underlying the extremely appealing guide is 
Yahoo!’s scaleable core technology in search engine, database struc-
ture, and communication software. These core technologies are relevant 
to the user’s experience to the extent that it enables Yahoo! customers’ 
access to a broader array of high quality information in an intuitive 
way, faster than any competitors product. Yahoo! is discussing a full 
license to advanced web-wide search engine technologies, web-wide 
index data, and crawler services with Open Text of Waterloo, Canada. 
Yahoo! will be the first guide with a seamless integrated directory/
web-wide search product. The proposed agreement with Open Text also 
includes ongoing joint development of advanced search and database 
technologies leveraging the strengths of both companies. All jointly 
developed products will be distributed by Yahoo! allowing the company 
to continue to introduce advanced features on a regular and aggressive 
basis.
 ■ Extend the reach to a broader audience through establishment of 
 contractual relationships with Internet access providers such as MSN, 
America Online, and Compuserve and very popular web sites.

APPENDIX    Cases534
 ■ Extend the reach and appeal to international users through partnerships 
with international access providers who can operate foreign mirror sites for 
Yahoo and add localization in the form of foreign language, local advertis-
ers, and local content.
 ■ Retain the users (“readership”) of Yahoo! through constant enhancements 
to the content and interface of the guide.
 ■ Rapidly extend the product line by introducing regional guides, vertical 
market guides, and more importantly, individually personalizeable guides. 
Our intention is to be the first to market in all or most of these categories 
and outrun our competition by constantly “changing the competitive rules 
and targets.” Our introduction of personalized guides will be a first in the 
market and will leverage core technology owned both internally as well as 
through our license with Open Text.
Market Analysis
The Internet, whose roots trace back almost 20 years, is experiencing a period 
of incredibly rapid growth in the area of online access base and user popula-
tion. According to IDC and a recent report by Montgomery Securities, there 
are approximately 40 million users of the Internet, a majority using it only for 
email. However, it is estimated that about 8 million people have access to the 
Internet and World Wide Web. Most of these access the Web from the work-
place because of the availability of high bandwidth hardware and communica-
tions ports there. It is expected that over the next two to four years as higher 
bandwidth modems, home-based ISDN lines and cable modems are adopted, 
that both the growth and penetration of Web access into the home will increase 
dramatically. IDC estimates that by 2000, 40 percent of the homes and 70 per-
cent of all businesses in the United States will have access to the Internet. In the 
Western European and Japan markets, the comparable penetration rates might 
be as high as 25 percent and 40 percent respectively. If this holds true, there 
will be as many as 200  million users on the Internet and Web by the year 2000.
Market Segmentation and Development
We believe that between now and the year 2000 there will be three principal user 
groups driving the growth of the Web:
 ■ Large businesses using the Internet for both internal wide area information 
management and communication as well as intrabusiness communication 
and commerce.
 ■ Small home based businesses using it for retrieval of information relevant to 
the business as well as for vendor communication and commerce.
 ■ The individual user/consumer using it initially to find and access informa-
tion which is relevant to their personal entertainment and learning and later 
to make purchases of products and services.

  Yahoo! 535
We also believe that the evolution of the Internet will include three stages of 
market development:
 ■ Availability and proliferation of enabling technology.
 ■ Establishment of widespread access and communication services.
 ■ Widespread distribution of high value content.
We are currently in the first stage of market development consisting pri-
marily of infrastructure building and including rapid growth in the adoption 
and sale of computer, network, and communication products and entering into 
the second stage involving the initial establishment of “access” service based 
businesses.
Internet Market Size
Estimates of the amount of current and projected revenue for Internet related 
business vary. However, primary research conducted by both Montgomery 
Securities as well as Goldman Sachs indicate that the total served market for 
Internet hardware, software, and services will total approximately $1B in 1995, 
up from approximately $300M in 1994. Projections are that these categories 
might grow to a total of $10B by the year 2000. Several research firms including 
Forrester and Alex Brown & Sons have estimated the revenues to be produced 
by Web-based advertising at approximately $20M in 1995, $200M in 1996, and 
over $2B by the year 2000.
Market Trends
During the current, rapidly expanding stages of market and industry develop-
ment, the following trends are clear:
 ■ There is large scale adoption of enabling technology in the areas of  network 
hardware and software, as well as communication hardware and software. 
The World Wide Web with its inherent support of multimedia begs for 
the adoption of higher and higher bandwidth platform and  communication 
hardware and software.
 ■ Telecommunication companies and newly entering Internet access providers 
are rushing to put in place basic “hook-ups” in high bandwidth form.
 ■ The price for high-speed computer and communication “port” hardware 
and software of adequate bandwidth to support acceptable levels of trans-
port and display is still somewhat high. Partly for this reason, the adop-
tion of fully capable ports onto the Web is still principally occurring at 
businesses.
 ■ With the availability of 28.8K baud modems, ISDN lines and high 
performance/low price personal computers, home adoption of 
 Internet access is on the rise and slated to have extremely high growth 
over the next five years. Adoption of cable modems could accelerate this 
trend.

 ■ Formerly closed network online services such as America Online, Com-
puserve, and Prodigy are now offering Internet access and opening up their 
services. Other companies such as Microsoft as well as divisions of MCI, 
AT&T, and others are attempting to put in place Internet online services in 
which a range of programming content is presented.
 ■ Companies such as Yahoo! which provide means to navigate the Web are 
growing rapidly as measured by amount of end user traffic.
 ■ These high traffic sites already provide a high volume platform for 
 delivering electronic advertising.
During this stage, and sustainably for all stages to come, there is one funda-
mental need which users have: The location of meaningful information easily and 
quickly on this large and exponentially growing source called the Internet.
Competition
Yahoo! intends to effectively beat any emerging competitors by:
 ■ Establishing broader distribution earlier than any other competitor in order 
to maintain the Yahoo! guide as the most widely used in its class.
 ■ Broadening the product line faster than the competition through the intro-
duction of vertical market focused guides and personalizeable  editions of 
the guide.
 ■ Staying ahead of the competition with regular core product updates which 
continue to make it faster, easier to use, and more effective.
 ■ Delivering high quality audiences and compelling results to advertisers.
Risks
The main risks facing Yahoo! are:
 ■ The ability to increase traffic and enhance the Yahoo! brand. Management 
believes it can achieve both these goals.
 ■ Ability to introduce key new products faster and better than the competi-
tion. We believe that our current core technologies and platform will allow 
us to do this if supplemented by funded expansion of product development 
and marketing functions.
 ■ Ability to develop an international presence and leading brand internation-
ally before the competition. At the present time, Yahoo! is being pursued 
by a number of very high visibility and capable international affiliates. The 
funded addition of limited marketing and business development resources 
will allow us to respond to these opportunities in a timely way.
 ■ The introduction of competitive products internally developed by access 
providers. While there is no assurance that this will not happen, we have 
secured relationships with several of the leading providers already in which 
the Yahoo! product is featured and are in advanced discussions with others.

  Yahoo! 537
We believe that many of the access providers already respect Yahoo!’s 
strong brand, comprehensive guide and focus and are concluding that they 
will not be inclined to reinvent this late in lieu of a mutually favorable 
affiliate business relationship with Yahoo!.
 ■ Ability to scale our support of both the traffic through our main site as well 
as mirror sites of our affiliates. If the demands of traffic outgrow the band-
width of servers we install, then response rates might go down and lead to 
customer dissatisfaction. Yahoo! has successfully scaled and operated its 
server site. We believe we will be able to support the needed growth.
 ■ That the growth of the Internet industry as a whole slows significantly, or 
that the adoption of the Web as a significant platform for advertising does 
not grow as projected. These are both out of Yahoo!’s control. However, 
the company believes that the industry is in a secure phase of adoption 
which should fuel growth.
Yahoo!’s sustainable advantages
The Internet is in a period of market development characterized by extremely 
high rates of both user traffic growth and entry of new companies focused on 
various products and services. By virtue of its early entry, Yahoo! has developed 
its current position as the leader in its segment. Yahoo!’s ability to sustain and 
grow its position will depend on a number of things. Some of these relate to its 
current core advantages and others relate to future execution of its strategy.
At present, Yahoo!’s core strategic advantages include:
 ■ It’s strong brand. The company executed early and well with its unique, 
context focused, quick and intuitive guide and benefited from the wide-
spread adoption of the Yahoo! product. The guide is the standard in the 
world of Web navigation.
 ■ Yahoo!’s scalable core technology in search engine, database structure, 
and communication software. These core technologies are relevant to the 
user’s experience to the extent that it enables the Yahoo! customer’s access 
to a broader array of high quality information in an intuitive way, faster 
than any competitor’s product.

APPENDIX    Cases538
BARBARA’S OPTIONS
Introduction
Barbara Arneson strolled through the campus of the University of Maryland at 
College Park on a Spring evening in 2014. She often came to the quad at the end 
of a day for some quiet reflective time. Tonight she was mulling over her career 
options and the path her life would take in the next few years. Graduation was 
only five days away, and tomorrow Barbara would pick up her parents at the air-
port for a short visit and the ceremony. She hoped to be able to share her career 
decision with them and then relax over the next few days.
Having completed an undergraduate degree in biology a year prior, Barbara 
would soon be receiving her masters degree in computer science from Maryland 
before beginning a career in high technology. Barbara felt lucky that she had 
been offered a number of career options, thanks to the strong high-tech economy 
and growth of investment in the new field of bioinformatics, which applied soft-
ware and Internet technology to the process of identifying and using genetic 
information for the life sciences industries. Barbara’s personal objective was to 
work in product development and eventually move into management and maybe 
someday start her own company. As an interim step, she thought she might 
return to graduate school for an MBA in a few years.
On this beautiful evening, however, Barbara had to make a  decision between 
two attractive job offers.
Barbara’s Dilemma
Barbara had interviewed extensively with high-technology companies, and had 
decided BioGene Systems, Inc., and InterWeb Genetics Corp. were her top 
choices. She had hoped to receive an offer from at least one of them, but had 
received offers from both. Now she had a tough decision.
BioGene was a 7-year-old company that was successful and had grown rap-
idly. Its product-development group was highly regarded technically, and Rasha 
Motwani, to whom Barbara would report, had more than 10 years of develop-
ment experience in several product areas in which Barbara was interested. She 
liked Rasha and felt she would learn a lot from her.
InterWeb was a start-up that had been funded about a year ago by two ven-
ture capital investors, both of whom had successfully funded technology com-
panies. The InterWeb team was hard at work on its first product, which would

of a situation. This case is based on a combination of experiences rather than on a particular person.

launch in about a year. Barbara would be joining a team of about 10 engineers, 
most of whom had extensive experience in the areas relating to the product they 
were developing. The technical team leader was Robert Jackson, one of the com-
pany founders, who was only a few years older than Barbara and had a reputa-
tion as a technical “visionary.”
Barbara had been trying to decide for several days. As she strolled toward 
her dorm, she reflected on her thoughts. “Okay, I’ve been trying to make a deci-
sion on the basis of my key priorities, namely the types of projects I would be 
working on, the quality of the people I would be working with, and the oppor-
tunities for personal growth. Although BioGene and InterWeb are not directly 
comparable—each has potential strengths and weaknesses—the fact is that I 
think I would be equally happy with either one. For me, the decision is a toss-
up. I guess the only way to determine which is better is to evaluate the financial 
offers. Because both proposed similar salaries and benefits, that means analyz-
ing the stock option offers.”
The Stock Option Packages
Not all companies offer stock options to new college graduates. Because of Bar-
bara’s success at school and a hot job market in bioinformatics, both BioGene and 
InterWeb had included a stock option package in their offers.
A stock option gives an individual the right to purchase, during a fixed time 
period called the “term,” a certain number of shares of stock from the company 
at a fixed price, called the “exercise price.” The option expires at the end of the 
term, but it can be “exercised” (or bought) all or partially during the term, usu-
ally subject to certain conditions such as “vesting.” Options have no financial 
risk to the employee—if the value of the stock remains below the exercise price, 
he or she need not ever exercise the option.
BioGene had offered Barbara options for 6,000 shares at an exercise price of 
$16.00 per share. BioGene had gone public in June 2008 at $10 per share, and 
the stock was currently selling for roughly $16. In extending the offer to Barbara, 
Karen Hershfield, manager of recruiting for BioGene, had said, “We have a proven 
record of rapid, profitable growth, and we expect that kind of growth to continue. 
You should receive a handsome return on this option package.”
InterWeb had offered 60,000 shares at an exercise price of $0.10 per share. 
Because the company was private, this price reflected a favorable pricing deci-
sion at the time of the venture capital investment received by the company. Rob-
ert Jackson, in discussing the offer with Barbara, had commented, “The great 
thing about going with a start-up is that if it is successful, everybody gets rich. 
Our business plan shows that we should be in a position to do our IPO (initial 
public offering) in 3 or 4 years, and because companies usually go public at $10 
to $15 per share, you can see that this option could be worth almost a million 
dollars!”
Both options had identical restrictions. Vesting was 25% per year with a 
term of 4 years. This meant that at the end of one year of employment, Barbara had

APPENDIX    Cases540
the right to exercise 25% of the shares at her discretion any time. At the end of 
two years of employment, she would vest for another 25%, and so on. If at any 
time she left the company, she could, within 90 days, exercise any options for 
which she was vested, but any unvested options would terminate. Any unexer-
cised portion of the option would expire at the end of 10 years from the start of 
employment.
Having decided that she would be equally satisfied with joining either com-
pany, Barbara was understandably excited by the prospect of big financial gains 
on stock options. She had even begun day-dreaming about what she could do 
with a financial windfall—travel abroad for a year, buy a new car for her par-
ents, and pay for an MBA without worrying about 2 years of no salary and huge 
loan payments. Because she had learned a lot about financial analysis in her 
entrepreneurship courses, she had obtained and analyzed financial data from 
both companies, as shown in Exhibits 1 and 2. She also had analyzed the oppor-
tunity and strategies of both companies, and felt each had excellent prospects of 
achieving its objectives. She had examined stock market data for public high-
tech companies and knew that the price/earnings (PE) ratios of bioinformatics 
companies averaged 25. InterWeb had offered a lot more shares than BioGene, 
but there was a higher element of risk. She knew that many start-ups failed to be 
successful.
She recalled that autumn day 5 years ago when her parents had dropped her 
off at school for the start of her freshman year. When she picked them up at the 
airport tomorrow, she wanted to share her career decision with them and make 
them proud of her.
Questions
 1. What is the number of shares outstanding at BioGene as of May 31, 2014? 
What is its current PE ratio? Why do you think it is higher than the cur-
rent average of other bioinformatics companies (Hint: consider the  recent 
 annual growth rates of revenues and profits)?
 2. What is Barbara’s potential percentage ownership in each firm?
 3. Compare the firms in 4 years (i.e., 2018) when the stock options will be 
fully vested. Assuming Barbara remains employed until that time, which 
stock option offer is better? Make sure to include the cost of the stock 
 options and state all critical assumptions.
 4. In addition to compensation matters, what other factors would you suggest 
Barbara consider in making her decision?

ARTEMIS IMAGES
Christine Nazarenus tried to retain her optimism. Thirteen had always been 
a lucky number for her, but Friday, the thirteenth of July, 2001, had the 
earmarks of being the unluckiest day of her life. She was more than disap-
pointed. She was shattered. Yet she knew that she had hard facts, not just 
gut feel, that offering images and products on the World Wide Web was 
the wave of the future. She was sure that the management team she had put 
together had the creativity and skills to turn her vision into reality. Man-
aging her own company had seemed the obvious solution, but she hadn’t 
counted on how overwhelming the start-up process would be. Now, two 
years later, she was trying to figure out what went wrong and if the company 
could survive.
It had been so clear on day one. Archived photographs and images had 
tremendous value if they could be efficiently digitized and catalogued. Sports 
promoters and publishers had stores of archived information, most of it inac-
cessible to those who wanted it. Owners and fans represented only part of the 
untapped markets that the Internet and digital technology could serve. She had 
conceived a simple business model: digitize documents using the latest tech-
nology, tag them with easy-to-read labels, and link them to search engines for 
easy retrieval and widespread use. But over the ensuing months, so many fac-
tors affected the look, feel and substance of the company that Artemis Images 
would become.
So many things seemed outside her control that she wondered how she 
could have been so sure of herself back in February of 1999. Enthusiasti-
cally, Chris had approached a number of friends and acquaintances to help 
in the formation of a new “dot.com” company that seemed a sure bet. Frank 
Costanzo, a former colleague from Applied Graphics Technologies (AGT), 
shared Chris’s enthusiasm, as did long-time friend George Dickert. George, 
in turn, contacted Greg Hughes, who was enrolled in a Business Planning 
course. Grateful for the opportunity to help launch a real company, Greg 
took the idea and honed it as part of a class assignment. The plan was a con-
firmation of Chris’s confidence in the venture. But as she looked over the 
original plan, she knew there was a lot of work yet to do. Greg understood 
the business idea, but he didn’t understand the work involved to actually run 
a business. George and Frank understood digital technology and project man-
agement, but, like Chris, had never launched, much less worked for, a start-
up company. Chris knew that she had the technology and talent she needed

and felt confident that the four friends could construct a business model that 
would put Artemis ahead of the current image providers. Greg’s business 
plan looked like the perfect vehicle to appeal to investors for the funds they 
needed to proceed.
The Business Idea
In 1999, Chris had been working for three years as VP-Sales out of the  Colorado 
office of AGT, a media management company that provided digital imaging 
management and archiving services for some of the largest publishers and adver-
tisers in the world. AGT had sent Chris to Indianapolis to present a content man-
agement technology solution to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Corporation 
(IMSC) as it prepared marketing materials for the 2001 Indy 500. IMSC is the 
host of the 80-plus-year-old Indy 500, the largest single-day sporting event in 
the world, NASCAR’s Brickyard 400, the second-largest single-day sporting 
event in the world, and other events staged at the track. Chris’s original assign-
ment was a clear one: IMSC needed to protect its archive of photographs, many 
of which had begun to decay with age. The archive included five million to 
seven million photographs and dynamically rich multimedia formats of video, 
audio, and in-car camera footage.
Chris discovered that the photo archives at IMSC were deluged with 
requests (personally or via letters) from fans requesting images. She was 
amazed that a relatively unknown archive had generated nearly $500,000 in 
revenues in 1999 alone. Further discussions with IMSC researchers revealed 
that requests often took up to two weeks to research and resulted in a sale of 
only $60 to $100. However, IMSC was not in a position, strategically or finan-
cially, to acquire a system to digitize and preserve these archives. Not willing 
to leave the opportunity on the table, Chris asked herself, “What is the value of 
these assets for e-commerce and retail opportunities?” Without a doubt, IMSC 
and some of her other clients (Conde Nast, BBC, National Motor Museum) 
would be prime customers for digitization and content management of their 
collections.
Chris knew that selling photos on the Internet could generate substan-
tial revenue. She conceived of a business model where the system would be 
financed through revenue-sharing, rather than the standard model where the 
organization paid for the system up front. IMSC was interested in this arrange-
ment, but it was outside the normal business practices of AGT. AGT wanted 
to sell systems, not give them away. They couldn’t see the value of managing 
other organizations’ content.
As Chris told the story, her visit to the archives at IMSC was her Jerry 
Maguire experience. In the movie, Jerry is sitting on the bed when everything 
suddenly becomes clear and now he must pursue his dream. Like Jerry, Chris 
believed so passionately that her idea would bear fruit that when AGT turned 
down Chris’s request for the third time, she quit her job to start Artemis Images 
on her own.

APPENDIX    Cases544
Building a Team
When AGT was not interested in Chris’s idea of on-site digitization and sale of 
IMSC’s photo archives, Chris was not willing to walk away from what she saw 
as a gold mine. She contacted her friends and colleagues from AGT. Swept up 
in the dot.com mania, Chris named her company “e-Catalyst.” e-Catalyst was 
incorporated as an S-corporation on May 3, 1999, by a team of four people: 
Christine Nazarenus, George Dickert, Frank Costanzo, and Greg Hughes. (See 
Exhibit 1 for profiles of these partners.) Expecting that they would each con-
tribute equally, each partner was given a 25 percent interest in the company. 
Chris fully expected them to work as a team, so no formal titles were assigned, 
largely as a statement to investors that key additions to the team might be needed 
and welcomed. As another appeal to potential investors—and to broaden the 
team’s expertise—Chris and George put together a roster of experts with content 
management, systems and technology experience as their first advisory board. 
Greg’s professor and several local business professionals agreed to serve on the 
board of advisors, along with an Indy 500 winning driver-turned-entrepreneur, 
and Krista Elliott Riley, president of Elliott Riley, the marketing and public 
relations agency that represented Indy 500 and Le Mans Sports Car teams and 
EXHIBIT 1 Artemis Images management team 1999–2000.
Christine Nazarenus, 34, was formerly vice president of national accounts for AGT, one of 
the top three content management system providers in the world securing million dollar deals 
for this $500 million company. She is an expert in creating digital workflow strategies and 
has designed and implemented content management solutions for some of the largest corpo-
rations in the world including Sears, Conde Nast, Spiegel, Vio, State Farm, and Pillsbury. 
Ms. Nazarenus has extensive general management experience and has managed a division of 
over one hundred people. Chris holds a BA in communications from the University of Puget 
Sound.
George Dickert, 32, most recently worked as a project manager for the Hibbert Group, a 
marketing materials distribution company. He has experience with e-commerce, Web-enabled 
fulfillment, domestic and international shipping, call centers and CD-ROM. He has over-
seen the implementation of a million-dollar account, has managed over $20 million in sales, 
and has worked with large companies including Hitachi, Motorola, ON Semiconductor, and 
Lucent Technologies. Mr. Dickert has an MBA from the University of Colorado. George and 
Christine have been friends since high school.
Frank Costanzo, 40, is currently a senior vice president at Petersons.com. Petersons.com 
has consistently been ranked as one of the top one hundred sites worldwide. Mr. Costanzo is 
an expert in content management technology and strategy and was previously a vice presi-
dent at AGT. Mr. Costanzo has done in-depth business analysis and created on-site service 
solutions in the content management industry. He has worked on content management solu-
tions for the world’s top corporations including General Motors, Hasbro, Bristol-Meyers 
Squibb, and Sears.
Greg Hughes, 32, is currently a senior sales executive with one of the largest commercial 
printers in the world. Mr. Hughes has 10 years’ sales experience and has sold million-dollar 
projects to companies like US West, AT&T, R. R. Donnelly, and MCI. His functional exper-
tise includes financial and operational analysis, strategic marketing, fulfillment strategies 
and the evaluation of start to finish marketing campaigns. Mr. Hughes has an MBA from the 
University of Colorado.

drivers. Chris felt confident that her team had the expertise she needed to launch 
a truly world-class company.
Chris and George quit their jobs and took the challenge of building a com-
pany seriously. They contacted one of the Rocky Mountain region’s oldest and 
most respected law firms for legal advice. They worked with two lawyers, one 
who specialized in representing Internet companies as general counsel and 
one who specialized in intellectual property rights. With leads from her many 
 contacts at AGT, Chris contacted venture capitalists to raise money for the 
 hardware, software licensing, and personnel costs of launching the business.
The dot.com bust of 2000 did not make things easy. Not wanting to look 
like “yet another dot.com” in search of money to throw to the wind, Chris and 
her team changed their name to Artemis Images. Artemis, the Greek goddess of 
the hunt, had been the name of Chris’s first horse as well as her first company, 
Artemis Graphics Greeting Cards, her first entrepreneurial dabble at the age of 
16. Chris had always been enthralled with beautiful images.
Artemis Images’s Niche
In her work at AGT, Chris had observed that many organizations had vast stores 
of intellectual property (photos, videos, sounds and text), valuable assets often 
underutilized because they exist in analog form and may deteriorate over time. 
Chris’s vision was to preserve and enable the past using digital technology and 
the transportability of the World Wide Web. Chris envisioned a company that 
would create a digitized collection of image, audio and video content that she 
could sell to companies interested in turning their intellectual property into a 
source of revenue.
Publishers and sports promoters were among the many organizations with 
large collections of archived photos and videos. Companies like Boeing, General 
Motors, and IMSC are in the business of producing planes, cars, or sporting events, 
not selling memorabilia. However, airplane, car, and sports fans are a ready market 
for photos of their favorite vehicle or videos of their favorite sports event.
Proper storage and categorization of archived photos and videos is complex 
and expensive. In 2000, the two common solutions were to sell the assets out-
right or to set up an in-house division devoted to managing and marketing them. 
Most organizations were unwilling to sell their assets, as they represented their 
priceless brand and heritage. Purchasing software and hiring specialized person-
nel to digitize and properly archive their assets was a costly proposition that 
lay beyond the core competence of most companies. Chris’s work with AGT 
convinced her that there were literally thousands of companies with millions 
of assets that would be interested in a company that would digitize and manage 
their photo and video archives.
Chris understood a company’s resistance to selling its archives, and the 
high cost of obtaining and scanning select images for sale. However, she also

sharing model whereby Artemis Images would digitize a client’s archives but 
would not take ownership. Instead, her company would secure exclusive license 
to the archive, with 85 percent of all revenue retained by Artemis Images and 15 
percent paid to the archive owner. She expected that the presence of viewable 
archives on the Artemis Images website would lure buyers to the site for subse-
quent purchases.
The original business model was a “B2C” (business-to-consumer) model. 
Starting with the IMSC contract, Artemis Images would work with IMSC to 
 promote the Indy 500 and draw the Indy race fans to the Artemis Images website. 
Photos of the current-year Indy 500 participants—and historical photos includ-
ing past Indy participants, winners, entertainers, celebrities (e.g., Arnold Palmer 
on the Indy golf course)—would be added to IMSC’s archived images and sold 
for $20 to $150 apiece to loyal fans. A customer could review a variety of photo 
options on the Artemis website, then select and order a high- resolution image. 
The order would be secured through the Web with a credit card, the image trans-
ferred to the fulfillment provider, and a hard copy mailed to the eager recipient. 
The website was sure to generate revenue easier than IMSC’s traditional sales 
model of the past.
Having established the model with IMSC content in the auto racing market, 
Chris and George built the business plan around obvious market possibilities that 
might appeal to a wider range of consumers and create a comprehensive resource 
for stock photography. Since the Artemis Images team had prior  business dealings 
with two of the three largest publishers in the world, publishing was the obvious 
target for future contracts. Future markets would be chosen similarly, where the 
Artemis team had established relationships. These markets would be able to build 
on the archive already created and would bring both consumer-oriented content 
and saleable stock images. Greg made a list of examples of some industries and 
the content that they owned:
 ■ Sports: images of wrestling, soccer, basketball, bodybuilding, football, 
extreme sports
 ■ Entertainment: recording artists, the art from their CDs, movie stars, pic-
tures of events, pictures from movie sets
 ■ Museums: paintings, images of sculpture, photos, events
 ■ Corporations: images of food, fishing, planes, trains, automobiles
 ■ Government: coins, stamps, galaxies, satellite imaging
As Chris and George worked with Greg to put together the business plan, 
they began to see other revenue-generating opportunities for their virtual-archive 
company. Customers going to IMSC or any other Artemis client’s website 
would be linked to Artemis Images’s website for purchase of photos or videos. 
Customer satisfaction with image sales would provide opportunities to sell mer-
chandise targeted to specific markets and to syndicate content to other websites. 
For motor sports, obvious merchandise opportunities would include T-shirts, 
hats, and model cars. For landscapes, it might be travel packages or hiking gear.

Corporate customers might be interested in software, design services, or office 
supplies. Unique content on Artemis Images’s website could be used to draw 
traffic to other companies’ sites. Chris and her team planned to license the con-
tent on an annual basis to these sites, creating reach and revenues for Artemis 
Images.
Another potential market for Artemis Images lay in the unrealized value 
of the billions of images kept by consumers worldwide in their closets and 
drawers. These images were treasured family heirlooms which typically sat 
unprotected and underutilized. Consumers could offer their photographs for 
sale or simply pay for digitization services for their own use. If just 10% of 
the U.S. population were to allow Artemis Images to digitize their archive and 
half of these people ordered just one 8” 3 10” print, Artemis Images could 
create a list of 25 million consumers and generate revenues of approximately 
$250  million. Because images suffer no language barriers, the worldwide 
reach of the Internet and the popularity of photography suggested potential 
revenues in the billions.
Working together on the business plan, the Artemis team brainstormed 
ways they could attract customers to the Artemis Images site by providing 
unique content and customer experiences. A study by Forrester Research 
analyzed the key factors driving repeat site visits and found that high-quality 
content was cited by 75 percent of consumers as the number one reason they 
would return to a site. The Artemis team wanted to create a community of 
loyal customers through additional unique content created by the customers 
themselves. This would include the critical chats and bulletin boards that are 
the cornerstone of any community-building program. Artemis Images could 
continuously monitor this portion of the site to add new fan experiences to 
keep the experience “fresh.” Communities would be developed based on 
 customer interests.
As the company gained clients and rights to sell their archived photos 
and videos, Artemis would move toward a “B2B” (business-to-business) 
model. Chris and George knew marketing managers at National Geographic,  
CMG World Wide, the BBC, Haymarket Publishing (includes the Formula 1 
archive), Conde Nast, and International Publishing Corporation. These large 
publishers controlled and solicited a wide range of subject matter (fashion, 
nature, travel, hobbies, etc.) yet often had little idea of what existed in their 
own archives or had difficulty in getting access to it. Finding new images 
was usually an expensive and time-consuming proposition. Artemis Images 
could provide the solution. For example, Conde Nast (publisher of Vogue, Bon 
Appetit, Conde Nast Traveler, House & Garden, and Vanity Fair) might like 
a photo for its travel magazine from the National Geographic archives. They 
would be willing to pay top dollar for classic stock images, given the number 
of viewers who would see the image. Price-per-image was typically calculated 
on circulation volume, much like royalty fees on copyrighted materials. Simi-
larly, advertising agencies use hundreds of images in customer mockups. For 
example, an agency may desire an image of a Pacific island. If Artemis Images

APPENDIX    Cases548
held the rights to Conde Nast and National Geographic, there might be hun-
dreds of Pacific island photos from which to choose. As with the B2C concept, 
a copy of the image would be transferred through the Web with a credit card or 
on account, if adequate bandwidth were available (only low-resolution images 
would be available to view initially), or via overnight mail in hard copy or on 
disk.
The transition from B2C to B2B seemed a logical progression, one that 
would amass a large inventory of saleable prints and, at the same time, draw in 
larger per-unit sales. The basic business model was the same. Artemis would 
archive photos and videos that could be sold to other companies for publica-
tion and promotion brochures. Chris and George expected that this model could 
be replicated for other vertical markets including other sports, nature, entertain-
ment, and education.
While the refocus on the B2B market seemed a surer long-term revenue 
stream for the company, both B2B and B2C were losing favor with the invest-
ing community. Chris and George refocused the business plan as an application 
service provider (ASP). With the ASP designation, Artemis Images could posi-
tion itself as a software company, generating revenue from the licensing of its 
software processes. In 2000, ASPs were still in favor with investors.
Artemis Images’s revenue would come from three streams: (1) sales of 
images to businesses and consumers, (2) syndication of content, and (3) sales of 
merchandise. Projected sales were expected to exceed $100 million within the 
first four years, with breakeven occurring in year three. (See Exhibits 2, 3, and 4 
for projected volume and revenues.)
To implement this strategy, Artemis Images, Inc., needed an initial invest-
ment of $500,000 to begin operations, hire the team, and sign four additional con-
tent agreements. A second round of $1.5 million and a third round of $3  million 
to $8 million (depending on number of contracts) were planned, to  scale the 
concept to 28 archives and over $100 million in assets by 2004. (See Exhibit 5 
for funding and ownership plan.)
The Content Management Industry
According to GISTICS, the trade organization for digital asset management, the 
content management market (including the labor, software, hardware, and physi-
cal assets necessary to manage the billions of digital images) was projected to be 
a $2 trillion market worldwide in the year 2000 (1999  Market Report). Content 
could include images, video, text and sound. Artemis Images intended to pursue 
two subsets of the content management market. The first was the existing stock 
photo market, a business-to-business market where rights to images were sold 
for limited use in publications such as magazines, books, and websites. Deutsche 
Bank’s Alex Brown estimated this to be a $1.5 billion market in 2000. Corbis, 
one of the two major competitors in the digital imaging industry, estimated it to 
be a $5 billion market by 2000.

Commercially produced images were also in demand by consumers. Indus-
try insiders believed that this market was poised for explosive growth in 2000, as 
Web-enabled technology facilitated display and transmission of images directly 
from their owners to individual consumers. The archives from the Indianapolis 
Motor Speedway was an example of this business-to-consumer model. Histori-
cally, consumers who bought from the archive had to visit the museum at IMSC 
or write a letter to the staff. Retrieval and fulfillment of images then required a 
manual search of a physical inventory, a process which could take as long as two 
weeks. Web-based digitization and search engines would reduce the search time 
and personnel needed for order fulfillment and allow customers the convenience 
of selecting products and placing orders on-line. The Daily Mirror, a newspaper 
in London, had displayed its archived images on its own website and had gener-
ated over $30,000 in sales to consumers in its first month of availability. IMG, 
a sports marketing group, placed a value of $10 million on the IMSC contract.
Competition
There were a variety of stock and consumer photo sites ranging from those that 
served only the  business-to-business stock photo market to amateur photogra-
phers posting their pictures. Most sites did not offer a “community,” the Internet 
vehicle for consumer comments and discussion, a powerful search engine, and 
ways to repurpose the content (e-greeting cards, prints, photo mugs, calendars, 
etc.). In addition, the archives available in digital form were limited because 
other content providers worked from the virtual world to the physical world 
versus the Artemis Images model of working from the physical world to the 
virtual world. Competitors had problems with integrated digital workflows and 
knowing where the original asset resided due to the distributed nature of their 
archives. They scanned images on demand, which severely limited the content 
available to be searched on their websites.
Chris and Greg evaluated the five major competitors for their business plan:
www.corbis.com: Owned by Bill Gates with an archive of over 65 million 
images, only 650,000 were available on the Web to be accessed by consum-
ers for Web distribution (e-greeting cards, screen savers, etc.). Only 350,000 
images were available to be purchased as prints. The site was well designed 
and the search features were good, but there was no community on the site. 
The niche Corbis pursued was outright ownership of archives and scanning 
on demand. Corbis had recently acquired the Louvre archive, for a reported 
purchase price of over $30 million.
www.getty-images.com: An archive of over 70 million images. In 1999, this 
site was only a source to link to their other wholly owned subsidiaries, includ-
ing art.com. There were no search capabilities, no community. This website 
functioned only as a brochure for the company. Like Corbis, Getty was 
focused on owning content and then scanning on demand.
www.art.com: A good site in design and navigation, this site was a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Getty and was positioned as the consumer window to a 
bye23429_appB_497-580.indd   553bye23429_appB_497-580.indd   553 12/2/13   11:56 AM12/2/13   11:56 AM

portion of the Getty archive. Similar to Corbis, customers were able to buy 
prints, send e-greeting cards, etc. Despite the breadth of the Getty archive, this 
site had a limited number of digitized images available.
www.mediaexchange.com: Strictly a stock photo site targeted toward 
news sources, the site was largely reliant on text. It was difficult to navi-
gate and had an unattractive graphical user interface.
www.thepicturecollection.com: Strictly a stock site offering the Time 
photo archive, this site was well designed with good search capabilities. 
Searches yielded not only a thumbnail image but a display of the attached 
locator tags, or metadata.
www.ditto.com: The world’s leading visual search engine, ditto.com 
enabled people to navigate the Web through pictures. The premise was 
two-fold: deliver highly relevant thumbnail images and link to relevant 
Web sites underlying these images. By 2000, they had developed the larg-
est searchable index of visual content on the Internet.
Exhibit 6 shows a comparison of Artemis Images to the two major players 
in the stock photography market, Getty and Corbis. This table illustrates only 
revenues from stock photo sales and does not include potential revenue from con-
sumer sales, merchandise, advertising or other potential revenue sources.
According to its marketing director, Corbis intended to digitize its entire 
archive, and was in the process of converting analog images into digital images, 
with 63 million images yet to be converted. While Getty and Corbis were estab-
lished players in the content industry, they were just recently feeling the effects 
of e-commerce:
 ■ In 1999, Corbis generated 80 percent of its revenues from the Web versus 
none in 1996.
 ■ Getty’s e-commerce sales were up 160 percent between 1998 and 1999.
 ■ 34 percent of Getty’s 1999 revenues came from e-commerce versus 17 per-
cent in 1998.
Strategy
Artemis Images intended to provide digitization and archive management by 
employing a professional staff who would work within each client-company’s 
organization, rather than in an off-site facility of its own. Chris’s model was to 
provide digitized archive services in exchange for (1) exclusive rights to market 
the content on the Internet, (2) merchandising rights, and (3) promotion of Arte-
mis Images’s URL, effectively co-branding Artemis Images with each client-
partner. Chris envisioned a software process that would be owned or licensed by 
Artemis, and which could be used for digitizing different archive media, such as 
photos, videos, and text.
Chris and George expected Artemis Images to partner with existing sellers 
of stock photography and trade digitizing services for promotion through their 
sales channels. Artemis Images would pursue these relationships with traditional

sales and marketing techniques. Sales people would call on the major players and 
targeted direct mail, trade magazine advertising and PR would be used to reach 
the huge audience of smaller players. In addition, content partners were expected 
to become customers, as they were all users of stock photography.
As Artemis Images gained clients, the company would have access to some of 
the finest and most desirable content in the world. Chris knew that the workflow 
expertise of the management team would put them in a good position to  provide 
better quality more consistently than either Corbis or Getty. This same expertise 
would allow Artemis to have a much larger digital selection, with a website design 
that would be easily navigable for customers to find what they needed.
Using on-site equipment, the client’s content would be digitized, annotated 
(by attaching digital information tags, or metadata) and uploaded to the corporate 
hub site. Metadata would allow the content to be located by the search engine

**Estimates based on scanning 1,920 images a day per scanner, 2 scanners per archive. As scanning technologies improve, the 
throughput numbers were expected to go up.
***The percentage of the Artemis Images archive that needed to be sold to hit revenues projections varied between 0.03% and 0.22%, 
as compared to an actual 2.35% for Getty and to 0.6% for Corbis.
****The Artemis Images revenue numbers were based on selling a certain number of images at $150 per image; $150 was the 
 minimum average price paid for stock photographs. Corbis was privately held; this figure was an estimate.

and thus viewed by the consumer. For example, a photo of Eddie Cheever win-
ning the Indy 500 would have tags like Indy 500, Eddie Cheever, win photo, 
1998, etc. Therefore, a customer going to the website and searching for “Eddie 
Cheever” would find this specific photo, along with the hundreds of other photos 
associated with him. The Artemis corporate database was intended to serve as the 
repository for search and retrieval from the website.
The traditional content management strategy forced organizations to pur-
chase technology and expertise. Artemis Images’s model intended to alleviate 
this burden by exchanging technology and expertise for exclusive web distribu-
tion rights and a share of revenues. The operational strategy was to create an 
infrastructure based on installing and operating digital asset management sys-
tems at their customers’ facilities to create a global digital archive of images, 
video, sound and text. This would serve to lock Artemis Images into long-term 
relationships with these organizations and ensure that Artemis Images would 
have both the historical and the most up-to-date content. Artemis Images would 
own and operate the content management technology, with all other operational 
needs outsourced including Web development, Web hosting, consumer data 
collection, and warehousing and fulfillment of merchandise (printing and mail-
ing posters or prints). Artemis Images would scan thousands of images per day, 
driving down the cost per image to less than $2.00, versus the Corbis and Getty 
model of scan-on-demand, where the cost per image was approximately $40.00. 
The equipment needed for both the content management and photo  production 
would be leased to minimize start-up costs and ensure greater  flexibility in the 
system’s configuration.
The original plan was to purchase and install software and hardware at their 
main office in Denver, Colorado, contract with a Web development partner, 
and set up the first on-site facility at Indianapolis Motor Speedway Corpora-
tion. The Denver facility would serve as a development lab, to create a standard 
set of metadata to be used by all of their partners’ content. This consistency of 
 annotation information was intended to allow for consistent search and retrieval 
of content. Artemis Images’s goal was to build a world-class  infrastructure to 
handle content management, consumer data collection, and e-commerce. This 
infrastructure would allow them to amass a large content and transaction volume 
by expanding to other market segments. Developing their own structure would 
ensure standardization of content and reduced implementation time. Outreach 
for news coverage and the development of community features would be nego-
tiated concurrently. The time line in Exhibit 7 illustrates the Artemis Images 
development plan.
Financial Projections
Revenues were expected to come from four primary sources:
Consumer photos: IMSC’s archive sold approximately 53,000 photos in 
1999 to a market limited to consumers who visited the archive or wrote 
to its staff. Artemis Images based its projected sales on an average of

“soft launch”
Phase One
This phase was intended to take Artemis Images from initial funding to operationally being ready to sell images and 
take orders. The three main components included establishing the on-site facility at IMSC, construction and testing 
of the website and establishing the fulfillment operations. Phase one assumed money was in the bank.
Phase Two
This phase assumed that three additional archives had been secured and implemented, at least one of which would 
include breadth of content. Focus would be sales and ramping up revenues. B2B and B2C marketing strategies were 
to be executed and evaluated. Toward the end of phase two, three more archives would be secured.
Phase Three
Phase three  continued to build more archives and breadth of content. Marketing and sales would continue to be 
core focus for revenue development. Audio and video content assessed based on the state of market and technology 
(e.g., bandwidths) and a decision would be made on timing to enter this market.

15,000 images sold per archive in 2001, increasing to 20,000 images per 
archive in 2003. Price: $19.99 (8” 3 10”).
Stock photos: Stock photos ranged in price from $150 to $100,000, 
depending on the uniqueness of the photo. Competitors Getty and Corbis, 
two of the leaders in this market, sold 2.35 percent and 0.6 percent of their 
archive, respectively. Based on an average selling price of $150, Getty 
generated approximately $6.00 in revenue for each image in its archive; 
Corbis generated approximately $1.85. Artemis Images constructed finan-
cial projections based on sales of 0.30 percent of its archive in 2001 and 
0.16 percent of its archive in 2002. Artemis Images’s margin was based on 
a return of $0.20 per image in its archive for 2001, increasing to $0.60 per 
image in 2003.
Syndication: The team’s dot.com experience led them to believe that web-
sites with exclusive content were able to syndicate their content to other 
websites. They anticipated that Artemis Images would generate revenues 
of $100,000 per year from each contract for content supplied as marketing 
tools on websites. Existing companies with strong content had been able to 
negotiate five new agreements per week for potential annual revenues of 
$5 million.
Merchandise: According to America Online/Roper Starch Worldwide, 
approximately 30 percent of Internet users regularly make purchases. Arte-
mis Images used a more conservative assumption that only 1 percent of 
unique visitors would make a purchase. Estimates of the average purchase 
online varied widely, ranging from Wharton’s estimate of $86.13 to eMar-
keters’s estimate of $219. The Artemis Images team viewed $50 per pur-
chase as a conservative figure.
Chris and George felt confident that Artemis Images would be able to reach 
the revenue projections for number of photos sold. IMSC’s archive had sold 
approximately 53,000 photos in 1999, an increase of 33 percent over 1998. 
These sales had been generated solely by consumers who had visited the archive 
in person, estimated at 1 million people. In other words, one out of every 28 
possible consumers actually purchased an image. Chris and George assumed 
that if even one out of 160 unique visitors to the website purchased a photo, the 
Artemis website would generate 42 percent more than IMSC’s 1999 figures (see 
Exhibit 6 for projected sales volume). Chris and George believed that this pro-
jection was reasonable in light of the fact that IMSC did not market its archive 
and significant publicity and advertising would accompany Artemis Images’s 
handling of the archive. As breadth of content and reach of the Web increased, 
2002 revenues should easily be double those of 2001.
Since the team previously had configured and sold content management sys-
tems, they were familiar with the costs associated with this process, including 
both equipment and personnel. They carefully conducted research to stay abreast 
of recent improvements in technology and intended to be on the lookout for cost 
reductions and process improvements.

The Launch: Problems from the Start
Chris dove into the Artemis Images project with a vengeance. Having secured a 
five-year contract for exclusive rights and access to the IMSC archive, she found 
a dependable technician who was eager to relocate to Indianapolis to start the 
scanning and digitizing process. A reputable, independent photo lab agreed to 
handle printing and order fulfillment. Chris’s visit to the Indy 500 in May 2000 
was a wonderful networking opportunity. She met executives from large com-
panies and got leads for investors and clients. She secured an agreement with a 
Web design company to build the Artemis Images site, careful to retain owner-
ship of the design. She contacted over 100 potential venture  capitalists and angel 
investors.
Personally, she was on a roll. Financially, she was rapidly going into 
debt. Frank and Greg, legal owners of the company, had long since contrib-
uted ideas, contacts, or legwork to the Artemis Images launch. While con-
fident that his work on the business plan would appeal to investors, Greg 
viewed the start-up company as a risk to which he was unwilling to com-
mit. Likewise, Frank decided to hold onto his job at Petersons.com, a unit 
of Thompson Learning, until the first round of investor funding had been 
secured. Frank continued to offer advice, but he had a wife and two pre-
school-age children to support.
Each meeting with a potential funder resulted in a suggestion on how to 
make the business more attractive for investment. Sometimes they helped, 
sometimes they just added to Chris’s and George’s frustration. Beating the 
bushes for money over two years was exhausting, to say the least. The lack 
of funds impacted the look and feel of the business and severely strained 
relationships among the founding partners. Heated discussions ensued 
as to  the roles that each was expected to play, the reallocation of equity 
ownership in the company, and the immediate cash needed to maintain the 
 Indianapolis apartment and pay the scanning technician and Web develop-
ers, not to  mention out-of-pocket expenses needed to manage and market 
the business.
Chris and George appealed to their families for help. George’s father con-
tributed $5,000. Chris’s mother tapped into her retirement, mostly to pay Chris’s 
mortgage and to fund Chris’s trips to potential clients and investors in Lon-
don, New York, and Boston. By May 2001, Chris’s mother’s contribution had 
exceeded $200,000. A $50,000 loan from a supportive racing enthusiast pro-
vided the impetus for Artemis Images to reorganize as a C-corporation. All four 
original partners had stock in the new company, but Chris held the majority 
share (66 percent), George held 30 percent, and Frank and Greg’s shares were 
each reduced to 2 percent. Financial projections were revised downward (see 
Exhibit 8).
The site was officially launched on May 18, 2001. It was beautiful. Chris 
held her breath as she put in her credit card late that evening when the site went 
live. The shopping cart failed and the order could not be processed. Chris knew 
she was in trouble.

The Crash
From the first, the website had problems. The Web development contract stipu-
lated that the website for the Indy 500 would go live by May 8, 2001, to  coincide 
with the month-long series of events held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway 
leading up to the Indy 500 on May 27. However, the Web development took 
longer than anticipated, and the site was first operational on May 18. Having 
neglected to test the Web interface properly, serious failures were encountered 
when the site was activated. The site went down for 24 hours, only to face simi-
lar problems throughout the following week, again shutting down on May 27. 
More technical difficulties delayed the reactivation of the site until May 31, after 
the Indy racing series had ended.
Throughout June, consumer traffic was far less than originally anticipated. 
The site was not easily navigable. The shopping cart didn’t work. Yet the Web 
builder demanded more money. Fearful of a possible lawsuit, investors stayed 
away. The crash of the dot.coms added kindling to the woodpile. Chris and 
George started to rethink their original business model. They were held hostage, 
as they owned no tangible assets.
Website tracking data indicated that between May and July there had been 
at least $40,000 worth of attempted purchases. Chris read through hundreds of 
angry e-mails, and tried manually to process orders. Orders which were success-
fully executed resulted in spotty fulfillment. Many photos ordered were never 
shipped, were duplicated, or were incorrectly billed. At the same time, she tried 
to negotiate with the software developers’ demand for payment and keep alive a 
$250,000 investment prospect.
On July 9, 2001, the Web development company threatened an all-or-nothing 
settlement. They wanted payment in full for the balance of the contract even 
though the sites didn’t work. Absent full payment, they would shut down the 
sites within the week. The investor offered to put up 80 percent of the balance 
owed on the full contract to acquire the code to fix it. The company refused. On 
Friday, July 13, Chris had to tell IMSC that in less than 48 hours the sites would 
be shut down. The investor took his $250,000 elsewhere.
On Tuesday, July 17, Chris called an emergency meeting with George. 
George had had enough. The stress was affecting his health, his relationships, 
and his lifestyle. He believed that his family had already contributed more 
money than he had a right to ask. He was putting in long hours with no money to 
show for his efforts. His girlfriend had been putting pressure on George to quit 
for some time. Now he had run out of reasons to stay.
Chris was devastated. How could she face the people in Indianapolis? It was 
hard for her to come to grips with having let them down. Having put so much of 
herself into this venture, she wasn’t sure she could let go. At the same time, she 
wasn’t sure how to go on.
Chris reflected, “At one time, I defined success by my title, my salary, and 
my possessions. Working for AGT, I had it all. I started Artemis Images because 
I really cared about IMSC and making the Indy motorsports images available to

its fans. Now, I realize that there is a profound satisfaction in building a com-

563  Sirtris Pharmaceuticals: Living  healthier, Longer (Abridged)
SIRTRIS PHARMACEUTICALS: LIVING 
 HEALTHIER, LONGER (ABRIDGED)
One Saturday in February 2007, Dr. David Sinclair and Dr. Christoph Westphal, 
co-founders of Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based life 
sciences firm, were about to start their weekly strategic planning meeting. Sir-
tris conducted research into age-related diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and 
Alzheimer’s. What attracted the attention of investors and the media, however, 
was that its research might lead to another result: extending human lifespans.
Sirtris had established a link between resveratrol (a compound found in 
red grapes) and sirtuins (a newly discovered family of enzymes with links to 
improved longevity and health in living organisms as diverse as yeast, mice and 
humans). Sinclair and Westphal were building Sirtris around the development of 
sirtuin-activating drugs for the diabetes market. The Sirtris team had developed 
its own proprietary formulation of resveratrol, called SRT501, and was devel-
oping new chemical entities (NCEs) that were up to 1,000 times more potent 
activators of sirtuins than resveratrol.
In the strategy meeting, CEO Westphal, and Sinclair, the co-chair of Sir-
tris’s scientific advisory board, were meeting with Dr. Michelle Dipp, senior 
director of corporate development, and Garen Bohlin, the company’s chief oper-
ating officer, to discuss three strategic options for Sirtris:
In-licensing. Should Sirtris in-license compounds to diversify its drug 
development platform beyond its narrow focus on SIRT1, one of seven sirtuin 
variants in the human body?
Partnership with Pharma. Should Sirtris partner with a large pharmaceuti-
cal firm? What would it mean for the organization to become tied to a pharma-
ceutical company at this stage of its development? Should it postpone any deal 
until it had more clinical data?
Nutraceuticals. Should Sirtris sell its proprietary version of resveratrol, 
SRT501, as a nutraceutical, an off-the-shelf health supplement that would not 
require FDA approval?
Anti-Aging Science
The quest for long life has spurred the imagination of people in virtually every 
era in human history. Ancient Greeks imagined immortal gods, the sixteenth cen-
tury Spanish adventurer Ponce de Leon searched for the fountain of youth, and 
21st century scientists tested rodents for life-extending biological compounds. 
Until the 1990s, the only proven means of increasing lifespan in any animal was 
to reduce its calorie intake; however, for decades scientists did not understand 
Professor Toby Stuart and Senior Researcher David Kiron, Global Research Group, prepared this case, 
with advice and contributions from Alexander Crisses. HBS cases are developed solely as basis for class 
discussion rather than to illustrate either effective or ineffective handling of an administrative situation.

the biological mechanism triggered by calorie reduction. In the 1990s, research 
indicated that calorie reduction was a biological stressor that activated a defen-
sive metabolic response. Few scientists paid much attention to this research as 
few serious scientists focused their careers on anti-aging studies.
Longevity research gained traction as a credible field of study in the 1990s 
after Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Leonard Guarente traced 
the molecular pathway of calorie reduction in yeast to sirtuins, which are pro-
teins (enzymes) found in all cells. In humans, there are seven types of sirtuins. 
Sirtris was focusing 90% of its R&D on one sirtuin, called SIRT1 in humans.
David Sinclair
Sinclair earned his Ph.D. from the University of New South Wales in 1995 and 
then joined Guarente in his MIT lab. In 1997, he published an article with Guar-
ente that described how the yeast equivalent of SIRT1 increased the longevity of 
yeast cells by 30%. In 1999, Sinclair left for a tenure track position at Harvard 
Medical School, but continued to collaborate with Guarente. They found that 
extra copies of the sirtuin gene extended the life span of roundworms — a very 
different organism than yeast—by as much as 50%. The search was on for sir-
tuin activating compounds. This was a high-stakes search. “No chemical or drug 
had ever increased the activity of sirtuins” said Dr. Dipp. “A compound that 
could activate sirtuins would increase the speed of cellular metabolism. It could 
have far reaching implications for human healthcare.”
In 2003, Sinclair discovered that resveratrol, a compound found in red wine, 
activated sirtuins in yeast cells, a discovery which indicated that it might be 
possible to develop a drug that could activate the sirtuin enzyme. One way to 
activate the enzyme was to optimize the effects of resveratrol by giving it to 
patients in a highly purified form. Another was to mimic the effects of resvera-
trol using an entirely new and more potent chemical structure. Sinclair pursued 
both approaches. He described his work in a September 2003 article in Nature 
magazine that drew the attention of Westphal who had recently been promoted 
to general partner at Boston’s Polaris Venture Partners.
Christoph Westphal
In four years at Polaris, Westphal had had several successful investments. He 
co-founded five companies and served as the original CEO at four of them. In 
all cases, Westphal recruited a CEO to replace himself while he remained on the 
board as lead investor once he got the company off the starting blocks. Two went 
public and in early 2007 had a combined market value of $1.4 billion. Philip 
Sharp, a Nobel Prize winning biologist and Sirtris advisor, described Westphal’s 
business and science acumen: “Christoph’s combination of skills is very rare. I 
haven’t seen his equivalent in 30 years of working in biotech.”

Technology Review recognized Westphal as one of the country’s top 100 Young 
Innovators Under 35.

The son of two doctors, Westphal, a former McKinsey consultant, sped 
through an MD/Ph.D. program at the Harvard Medical School in less than six 
years. He spoke four languages and was an accomplished musician. Several Sir-
tris board members described him as having “extraordinary energy,” and a “rock 
star” reputation in the biotechnology world. One stated, “He has an unusual com-
bination of abilities—to understand the science and its commercial potential, 
and explain it all clearly in an understated way that resonates with investors.”
Westphal had a distinctive approach to building biotech companies. His 
major successes both held initial public offerings (IPO) before many market 
watchers believed them to be ready. In both cases, Westphal teamed with world-
renowned authorities (with Paul Schimmel, a prominent scientist at the Scripps 
Institute, and biologist Philip Sharp at one; with Robert Langer, an MIT profes-
sor and one of the world’s most prolific scientist/entrepreneurs at the other). 
Westphal described the elements he looked for and the approach he took in 
starting and building companies: “You need fantastic science. Second, you need 
a great story. Third, you need great venture capital (VC) support and lots of 
money. I am a big believer in raising as much money up front as possible.”
Applying this model and exploiting an ever-growing network among the 
industry’s prominent players, Westphal had developed a successful approach to 
launching companies. In 2003, he read Sinclair’s paper in Nature and phoned 
Sinclair.
Launching Sirtris
Sinclair met Westphal and came away impressed. Six months later, Westphal 
expressed an interest in starting a company with Sinclair and Sinclair, who had 
been exploring such options with other investors, agreed. After an agonizing 
decision process, Westphal chose to join Sirtris as its full- time CEO. In contrast 
to his other start-ups, he planned to remain with the company this time, leaving 
behind the VC life and a high six-figure salary. He explained his decision:
Many people thought it was too risky to leave a successful VC career. I was 
taking a $500,000 paycut and my wife and I had just purchased an expensive 
house close to Fenway Park in Boston. At the time, David had no data that 
showed resveratrol activated sirtuins in mammals or could affect mamma-
lian glucose levels or insulin, although we hoped all that would prove true. 
My VC friends were telling me that I was not being rational. In some ways 
they were right, but I was excited about Sirtris in a way I had not been at my 
other companies.
Sirtris’s Scientific Advisory Board
Virtually all early-stage biomedical companies created scientific advisory boards 
(SABs). Among other roles, SAB members advised their companies on scientific 
strategies; they sometimes assisted in securing access to intellectual property 
produced by SAB members; and they served as portals that kept the company 
abreast of developments in the field. Sirtris’s goal was to form a world-class

APPENDIX    Cases566
SAB and attract the brightest scientists in the field of sirtuin research. Sinclair 
described the formation of the Sirtris SAB: “Christoph said, ‘Give me a list of 
the top 10 people in your field.’ Within two weeks, we were having conference 
calls with all of these people. In one case, an academic was going to start a rival 
company, and Christoph flew out to St. Louis and convinced him to join us 
instead.” One observer noted:
Since combining forces with Sinclair, Westphal has organized what is argu-
ably the most pedigree-rich scientific advisory board in biotech, including 
MIT’s Sharp; Robert Langer, one of medicine’s most prolific inventors, 
also of MIT; Harvard gene-cloning pioneer Thomas Maniatis; and Thomas 
Salzmann, formerly executive vice president of Merck’s research arm. The 
group now numbers 27, among them many of the world’s leading experts 
on sirtuins.
Westphal also assembled an impressive list of directors — they include 
Alkermes’s [founder Richard] Pops; [Rich]Aldrich, the Boston hedge fund 
manager and biotech veteran; and Paul Schimmel, a prominent scientist at the 
Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif., who has co founded half-a-dozen 
biotech concerns. Westphal’s right arm at Sirtris is chief operating officer Garen 
Bohlin, formerly a senior executive at Genetics Institute, a biotech now owned 
by Wyeth.

Growing Sirtris
In mid-2004, Westphal and Sinclair went on a road show to local Boston-area VC 
groups. In August, they obtained a $5 million seed (Series A) round of financing 
from Polaris Ventures and three other VC investors. Sinclair explained: “Chris-
toph was very good at getting us in to talk with the majority of VCs in the Bos-
ton area over a short period of time. Although a lot of people said “no” to us, 
Christoph set a small window of time to invest and more than a few people 
started getting nervous about being left out. The short timeframe built its own 
momentum and helped drive interest in the company.”
In November 2004, Westphal and Sinclair secured another $13 million in a 
Series A-prime round. (Exhibit 1 details Sirtris’s five investment rounds. Exhibit 2 
details pre-IPO financing at three comparable biotechnology firms.) Regarding the 
first two funding rounds, Westphal explained their ability to raise funds before the 
firm had any mammalian data:
We were very early in terms of the science. We raised $18 million without 
any mammalian data, something that is almost unheard of in today’s bio-
technology. Part of our success was getting people bit by the Sirtris bug. 
We had a long-term vision of where we could go with the biology and the 
anti-aging message is extremely powerful, especially when you are talking

to a bunch of aging, overweight guys who are prime targets for the drugs 
you want to develop.
Sirtris had to decide how to focus its drug development efforts. Sinclair had 
theorized that sirtuins played a role in diabetes, cancer, heart disease, neurode-
generative diseases and other disorders. One thing was clear: there would be 
no effort to claim anti-aging effects from any drug the firm produced since the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulated such claims, did 
not recognize aging as a disease. The firm ultimately decided to develop a drug 
for diabetes: a major disease afflicting millions of individuals worldwide.
Sinclair conducted experiments that sought a connection between resvera-
trol and sirtuins in mice. Westphal recalled, “By early 2005, David started get-
ting data in his lab that showed resveratrol was going to extend lifespan in a 
mammal. We had evidence you could lower glucose and insulin in mice. All 
of a sudden, we were getting real proof that this actually could be a drug; that 
this could actually be a very valuable company.” Sirtris began hiring its R&D 
team, successfully staffing leadership positions with executives who had had 
long stints at large pharmaceutical and biotech companies identifying small 
molecules, developing drugs, and advancing drugs through clinical trials. With 
their mammalian data Sinclair and Westphal sought additional capital to finance 
Sirtris’s R&D efforts. In March 2005, Sirtris closed on a $27 million Series 
B-round of financing.
In the next year, Sirtris made three significant advances. First, the company 
created a formulation for SRT501 that kept resveratrol in its active form and 
increased its absorption into the bloodstream. The result was that SRT501 could 
deliver five times more resveratrol into the blood stream than the best other for-
mulations currently available.
Second, Sirtris began conducting human clinical trials in India, assessing 
SRT501 as a diabetes therapy. The transition from an R&D-only company to 
a clinical-stage company was, as Westphal remarked, “an important milestone 
in our plan to develop a rich pipeline of therapeutics to treat diseases of aging.” 
Third, and perhaps most significantly, Sinclair showed that middle-age mice fed 
high-calorie diets with resveratrol could run further, were leaner, and lived 30% 
longer than control-group mice without resveratrol.
Sirtris researchers were exhilarated by these findings, in part because the 
data suggested that sirtuins could play a role in managing or even delaying the 
onset of type 2 diabetes. They were also excited because in the past experimental 
data with the same rat model had tended to foreshadow a higher probability of 
success for drugs in human trials. In April 2006, Sirtris closed on a $22 million 
Series C round of financing, and obtained a $15 million line of venture debt.
Throughout 2006, Sirtris gained momentum as Sinclair’s research made its 
way into high profile academic journals, newspapers, and other media. In June, 
Sirtris announced that it had successfully completed a Phase 1 safety trial of 
SRT501 with 85 human subjects. In October, an article about Sinclair’s work 
appeared on the front page of the Wall Street Journal. The following month,

papers published in Cell and Nature demonstrated that resveratrol increased the 
stamina of mice two-fold and significantly extended their lifespans. The 2006 
Nature article also demonstrated that sirtuin activation increased within the cell 
the number of functional mitochondria, the powerhouses that sustain a range of 
cellular activities including glucose metabolism.
In late fall of 2006, Sinclair received an unsolicited email from John Henry, 
owner of the Boston Red Sox baseball team, requesting a meeting. Westphal 
described the meeting:
After we present him the company, he says, “How can I be helpful to you?” 
I say, “I think you could invest $50 million in the company.” And he says, 
“I don’t think I can do $50 million, but I think I can do $20 million.” And 
I said, “Can we close in two weeks?” John teamed up with Peter Lynch, 
the legendary former fund manager of Fidelity’s Magellan Fund, who did 
extensive due diligence, and they said, “OK.” Everyone wanted in after that.
By February 2007, Westphal had closed on another round of financing, 
raising $35.9 million from company executives, venture firms from previous 
rounds, as well as from John Henry and Peter Lynch. Westphal explained, 
“We’ve always been able to raise money, I think because we had money. We 
weren’t desperate. Investors knew that they couldn’t get away with trying to 
hammer us on the valuation, because if we don’t get the valuation we want we 
just won’t raise the money.”
Moving Forward
Nutraceuticals
Westphal and Sinclair had a long-running debate over the commercial opportu-
nity represented by their proprietary formulation of resveratrol (SRT501). Sin-
clair believed that there would be great public demand for SRT501 long before 
the clinical studies were completed, and that Sirtris, one way or another, should 
start selling SRT501 to the public as a nutraceutical. Sinclair received 30 to 50 
emails a day from people looking to obtain resveratrol.
For a biotech company focused on drug development, a Sirtris foray into 
nutraceuticals would not be unprecedented. A few other biotechs had taken this 
step. Depending on its definition, market size estimates ranged from tens of bil-
lions to hundreds of billions of dollars in yearly sales.
3 Sales of one joint-health 
supplement exceeded $1 billion. 4 The economics of nutraceuticals were also 
compelling. It might cost $0.25 to manufacture each capsule. Current vendors 
of resveratrol that were far less well absorbed by the body than SRT501 were 
charging prices in the vicinity of $1 per capsule.
Westphal, however, had doubts about the nutraceutical option. There 
were several issues. The nutraceuticals market was unpredictable and largely

unregulated — no FDA approval was necessary to sell supplements and no evi-
dence was necessary to prove a product’s effectiveness or even its composition. 
Sinclair had tested resveratrol pills and found that some brands on the market 
had no active resveratrol at all and other brands had far too little to have any 
meaningful effects on humans. Even if Sirtris had a scientifically proven prod-
uct, it was not clear that science alone would be enough to differentiate its offer-
ing from those of the dozen other resveratrol providers. How would the company 
distinguish itself in this field? Another concern was safety. “The potential that 
someone could attribute a death to SRT501 could easily derail a nutraceuticals 
business,” said Sinclair.
Another concern was identity. Was the company a scientifically rigorous 
enterprise focused on developing FDA-approved medicines that physicians 
would prescribe to improve the health of patients with aging-related disorders? 
Would Sirtris’s brand suffer if it started selling nutraceuticals? Its office walls 
were plastered with pictures of Sinclair and Westphal with Nobel-prize winning 
biologists and luminaries from the VC world next to pictures of them with celeb-
rities. Rich Aldrich, one of the company’s original investors and current board 
member, explained: “The Sirtris story is a balance. It’s carefully constructed 
from the core science and Christoph and David’s public outreach. It’s not clear 
if a nutraceutical approach will taint that story or extend it.”
Next, what was the business case for entering the nutraceutical market? How 
much of a return would warrant Sirtris’s participation and how would market 
entry be achieved? Should the company set up a subsidiary or create a spin-off 
company devoted to SRT501? Would the nutraceutical subsidiary have the Sir-
tris name or a different name? Some Sirtris executives favored a wholly- owned 
subsidiary with a different name in order to make clear that the Sirtris brand 
was focused on drugs based on their NCE development platform. “Our long-
term investors like this option because they are in this company for the NCEs. 
They’re not in it for the 501 data,” said Westphal.
Yet another issue was retail format. Sirtris could sell SRT501 through the 
Internet or by partnering with supplement stores such as GNC. It could also 
open its own retail stores. Would partnering with a retailer reduce control over 
the brand? Would developing its own retail distribution take away from its drug 
development?
Pharmaceutical Deal
Throughout 2006, new evidence from laboratories around the world confirmed 
Sinclair’s hypothesis of a connection between resveratrol, sirtuins and metabolic 
activity in mammals. Several pharmaceutical companies began talking with 
Westphal about a possible drug development partnership. He anticipated that 
the terms of a deal could include a significant upfront cash payment, an equity 
purchase agreement, guaranteed R&D support that would likely step up over a 
four to five year period, and payments tied to clinical development milestones. 
Sirtris would also receive royalties on sales of any SIRT drugs. (See Exhibit 3  
for details on the potential terms of a deal and Exhibit 4 for details of two deals

between big pharma and other private biotechnology firms.) As an alternative, 
the team also believed that they could ink a deal with terms similar to those in 
Exhibit 3 but in which the pharmaceutical partner would take a 51% equity stake 
in the company.
Another reason to contemplate a deal was that it might be a relatively inex-
pensive source of additional capital. Pharmaceutical partners were often willing 
to purchase an equity stake at a premium to VC investors. They might also be 
willing to finance Sirtris’s R&D programs.
Westphal, Sinclair, and Dipp also considered that a drug development deal 
with a pharmaceutical company would help Sirtris should it decide to conduct 
an IPO, which they hoped to do. A successful IPO could deliver some of the 
funding needed to move drug development from the laboratory through clini-
cal trials. Westphal stated, “The typical biotech playbook says to get a partner-
ship deal done, then file for an IPO. Public investors are often reassured by the 
prior involvement of a pharmaceutical company.” One close advisor noted that 
a typical biotechnology company would not be a strong IPO candidate until it 
had developed some clinical data, successfully made headway on two differ-
ent research programs, established intellectual protection around its discovery of 
one or more new chemical entities, and signed at least one significant deal with 
a pharmaceutical company.
There were reasons not to do a deal. Westphal and Sinclair were building a 
company that they hoped would have great impact. This was the first company that 
Westphal had actively managed beyond the first two years. It was Sinclair’s first 
company. How would a deal affect their control over the company and its future?
Another reason to defer a deal was Sirtris’s promising development of NCEs. 
Resveratrol was a naturally occurring substance and because it was already on 
the market intellectual property protection related to it was limited. Sirtris had 
recently made strides in synthesizing new compounds that could be 1,000 times 
more potent than resveratrol and these would be patentable. Partnering with a 
pharma company would require out-licensing these compounds without know-
ing their full value. If Sirtris waited for more data, and that data was positive, 
it might be able to arrange a more lucrative deal. If the new data did not show 
the results Sirtris was expecting, the pharma deal terms would be substantially 
worse, assuming these companies remained interested at all.
In-Licensing or Expanding the Scientific Base
Sirtris executives had long debated how much of the company’s resources to 
focus on SIRT1 versus alternative sirtuin targets. The biotechnology industry was 
littered with failed companies that had stalled in moving from mouse studies and 
toxicity screens to human trials. Several board members thought that the firm 
should diversify its product development platform. There were two main alterna-
tives: investigate the six other human sirtuins or in-license a compound that had a 
better known mechanism of operation from another biotechnology firm.
The study of sirtuins was still in its infancy, so investigating the other 
 sirtuins would require a great deal of basic research, financing and time. (See

Exhibit 5 for Sirtris financial data, 2004-2006.) Even so, the clinical role of the 
other human sirtuins offered tantalizing commercial options.
Several members of the SAB and the board of directors considered the in-
licensing option to be appealing, while others disagreed. It would balance their 
investment in SIRT1, which was absorbing 90% of the firm’s R&D expendi-
tures. Dr. Dipp explained that, after investigating more than one hundred poten-
tial compounds to in-license, Sirtris had found a few anti-diabetic compounds 
that had better characterized effects than sirtuin-activating compounds. “It would 
be what we call “me-too” drugs. We know how they work, and if we could get 
them on the market they would get at least a small percentage of market share. 
It’s something to have in your back pocket.”
In 2004, Sinclair and Westphal debated, but decided against, in-licensing a 
compound. Sinclair stated, “I was the only person at the company who thought 
that SIRT1 activation was the right bet to make. I told Christoph, ‘don’t stop it 
until you know it’s wrong.’ If I’m wrong, find out sooner than later, and then 
in-license something.” Westphal offered another view, “For the first eight 
months of this company, I was sitting there like a venture guy thinking that res-
veratrol will not be a great drug. It’s a great story, but we’ll have to bring in other 
stuff to build the company around.”
Sinclair, Westphal, Bohlin and Dipp continued to debate whether to focus 
the firm’s time, money, and other resources on one target or divert more of the 
firm’s resources to additional targets, including non-sirtuins. They still did not 
have evidence that SIRT1 had the effects in humans that Sinclair believed they 
would one day see.
Conclusion
After discussing these three issues for several hours, Sinclair and Westphal 
decided to summarize their views on the decisions they needed to make. At a 
general level, they remained convinced that if sirtuin-activating drugs could be 
successfully developed, they would have a revolutionary impact on human dis-
ease. However, Sirtris was many years from completing development of these 
drugs, much less manufacturing and selling them. Success would require navi-
gating technical and regulatory hurdles that had stymied the majority of other 
biotechnology companies at similar points in their history. According to a 2007 
pharmaceutical industry association report, only one in five compounds entering 
clinical trials gained FDA approval and, only 30% of approved drugs recovered 
the average development cost of a new medicine.
5 Given all of the unknowns 
about what could happen, Sinclair and Westphal described several options for 
addressing the risks they faced.
One approach would be to fully “hedge their bets.” Sirtris could try to com-
plete a pharmaceutical deal, in-license a compound with better known effects, 
and enter the nutraceuticals business.

APPENDIX    Cases572
Another approach would be to “swing for the fences.” Sirtris could continue 
to focus on a sirtuin-activating drug development platform. If successful, Sirtris 
executives believed the sky was the limit. Under this option, however, an IPO 
would be less likely since markets often preferred that biotech firms had a vali-
dating deal with a large pharmaceutical company.
A third approach would be a “middle of the road” path that incorporated 
some hedging, such as pursuing an in-licensing deal, but also accepted some 
risk, such as deferring a potential pharmaceutical deal. Alternatively, Sirtris 
could try to complete a pharmaceutical deal now, but forego in-licensing and the 
nutraceuticals project.

Questions
1. What made Sirtris an attractive opportunity (and not just a good idea) at 
the time that Christoph Westphal joined as CEO? How will Sirtris make 
money?
2. Identify the major risks in each of these categories: technology, market, 
team, and financial. What is the most important category and risk?
3. Should Sirtris do the deal with the pharmaceutical company? Why or why 
not? Should Sirtris launch a neutraceuticals business? Why or why not?
4. Assume that Christoph Westphal and his team have just been told that J.P. 
Morgan Securities, which is a reputable investment bank, is eager to help 
Sirtris go public soon by filing for an Initial Public Offering (IPO). Fur-
thermore, assume that Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK) has also just contacted 
them to discuss an offer to buy Sirtris entirely. What are the advantages 
and disadvantages of each of these three options that they could pursue in 
order to finance and operate the venture (e.g., stay private for now and fund 
the company with more venture capital and corporate partnerships, take the 
company public via an IPO, or agree to be acquired to become an operating 
division of an established company)?

  Cooliris: Building An A1 Team 575
COOLIRIS: BUILDING AN A1  TEAM
Introduction
It was well past 2AM on a warm evening in July 2007 at the Kleiner Perkins 
Caufield Byers (KPCB) incubator in California. Josh Schwarzapel, the young 
and energetic co-founder of Cooliris, checked his email again to see if their top 
recruit had accepted the Cooliris employment offer. Across the gray cubicle 
wall, the technical team, Austin and Kyan, were coding steadily on the next 
product release. Although Austin and Kyan had been working feverishly for 
months, they urgently needed more engineers if they were to make the next 
release deadline. 
Three months earlier, when the Cooliris co-founders received their first 
round of funding from KPCB, Josh had accepted the challenge to help Cooliris 
expand by building a world-class technical team. At the time Josh had felt full of 
confidence: how difficult could it be for a young company to attract great talent 
when it had the backing of one of the world’s most successful venture capital 
firms, an incredible technical vision, an early product with great traction, and 
another product in the pipeline?
Much to Josh’s surprise, however, it had been challenging to build the 
team. Josh understood the importance of an outstanding team to the success of 
a new venture. As a student at Stanford studying entrepreneurship, Josh had 
heard luminaries in the field highlight the necessity of a world-class team for 
eventual success. But, as he struggled to find and attract such a team, Josh 
began to realize that his courses had not prepared him well for how to build 
such a team. Nonetheless, in Cooliris’ high-accountability culture, pointing 
the finger at an issue from his formal education would not excuse a failure. 
Soujanya Bhumkar, the company’s CEO, had been supportive and helpful along 
the way, but Josh could sense the pressure: from the investors, from Soujanya, 
and worst of all from the team who had been forced to work long hours as they 
waited for the much needed new hires. 
Now, in the early hours of the morning, Josh once again began to ask him-
self difficult questions.  Why had he struggled to recruit a great team? In the past 
he had always been successful, both as a student at Stanford and a collegiate vol-
leyball player. What had gone wrong? Inevitably, Josh began to ask himself . . . 
“Is it me? Have I failed?” 
This case was prepared by Nathan Furr via the Stanford Technology Ventures Program at Stanford 
 University with assistance from Josh Schwarzapel, Soujanya Bhumkar, and Professor Thomas Byers, as 
the basis for class discussion rather than to illustrate either effective or ineffective handling of an admin-
istrative situation. Some facts have been disguised.

APPENDIX    Cases576
COOLIRIS BACKGROUND AND HISTORY
At the time of Cooliris’ founding, the Internet underwent a transformation fre-
quently referred to as Web 2.0. During the first major Internet wave spanning 
the late 1990s, entrepreneurs and corporations focused primarily on establish-
ing a presence on the Internet using standard interface design to communicate 
with their audience. However, as the Internet evolved, a second wave emerged 
during the early 2000s that shifted the focus from corporate-generated content 
to user-generated content and from proprietary interfaces to modular interfaces 
that could be recombined (sometimes referred to as “mashable”). As part of this 
movement, a host of new websites, many of them funded by venture capitalists, 
sprung up to empower everyday users to become content publishers by posting 
blogs, making profiles, publishing videos, and sharing photos. Social networks 
such as MySpace and Facebook became household names and social network-
ing, or the connecting of users to each other in online communities, became a 
common buzzword for many online ventures. 
With the democratization of content creation and publishing, however, the 
sheer volume of content became a very real problem for most web users. As 
millions of participants posted billions of new photos, videos, and blogs, the 
quantity and type of information expanded exponentially. Narrow search terms 
returned hundreds of thousands of results, and information coming from one’s 
social graph on sites like Facebook and MySpace was becoming too lengthy to 
consume. In short, a growing challenge for Internet users was how to interact 
with and process the exploding volume of new content. It was this challenge that 
led to the founding of Cooliris. 
Soujanya, Josh and Austin Shoemaker founded Cooliris in January 2006 
around the idea that the Internet had indeed become a fundamental element in 
the lives of billions of people, but the user interaction metaphors had changed 
very little since the first browsers. In their view, the Internet had always been 
characterized by a clunky, non-intuitive navigation experience based on the 
table format inherent in HTML code. Although flash animations and video con-
tent had enriched basic text, the way people interacted with the Internet was still 
constrained within the 2D framework of the original browsers.
The initial idea for Cooliris had emerged earlier in 2005 during a con-
versation between Soujanya and a friend, Mayank Mehta. As the two talked 
about how to make the Internet a more rich experience, Mayank suggested the 
idea of creating a mouse-over preview of embedded links to other web pages. 
The preview would allow the user to see the content underneath the link in a 
contextual window without leaving the original page, thereby creating a more 
multi-dimensional media experience. Soujanya, a former engineer turned serial 
entrepreneur, was struck by the insight and began discussing it with colleagues 
to get their feedback. 
During this period, Josh and Soujanya met for coffee to discuss ideas. Josh 
caught the vision of a better Internet experience and connected Soujanya with 
Austin, a fellow student with exceptional technical capability. Together they laid

  Cooliris Background And History 577
out a plan for Cooliris and their first product: Cooliris Previews. The team began 
development right away, self-funded on Soujanya’s credit card and working part 
time while Josh and Austin finished school. By September of 2006, the team had 
released Cooliris Previews as a free Internet browser plug-in. 
Over the course of a few months, the product began to get significant trac-
tion, becoming a featured plug-in for Firefox and attracting thousands of users 
who desired a richer online experience. The success of Previews validated the 
primary Cooliris hypothesis that users desire a richer interaction with content, 
and so the team developed the concept for a second product: PicLens. The new 
PicLens product would allow users to view online photos from photo sharing 
sites or online image searches as full-screen slideshows rather than as low-
quality thumbnail images or larger files that had to be downloaded individually. 
PicLens felt like a natural next step for the young company, but as the team built 
the product, their vision of the company began to evolve into something big-
ger. The team realized that the challenge of improving web navigation extended 
beyond a browser add-in to the fundamental way in which users access, dis-
cover, and navigate information. The team began soliciting feedback from 
investors and industry friends on how to take their ideas to the next level.  In one 
such meeting, Randy Komisar, a partner at KPCB, suggested that his firm might 
be able to provide some funding and incubate the company in their adjacent 
offices. After several weeks of follow-on meetings with the KPCB partnership, 
Cooliris received and signed a term sheet for investment, taking up residence in 
the KPCB incubator next door to offices of such famous venture capitalists as 
John Doerr and Brook Byers.
Cooliris Hiring Process
After receiving funding and moving into their new offices on Sand Hill Road, 
the Cooliris team identified several critical next steps for the company. The team 
and investors decided that one of the most critical action items should be to 
hire a top-notch technical team to execute on the Cooliris vision. As Josh and 
Soujanya defined their recruiting strategy, they both agreed that they needed to 
recruit people who were both entrepreneurial and technically brilliant. Further-
more, they firmly believed in the wisdom of hiring great team members right 
from the beginning. As Guy Kawasaki of Garage Technology Ventures said, “A 
players hire A players, B players hire C players, and C players hire bozos.”
As the team discussed recruiting, hiring great team members seemed a com-
paratively easy task given their recent round of prestigious funding and their 
exciting technical vision. In Josh’s eyes, new recruits would get in on the ground 
floor of an exciting opportunity, operate in a highly supportive setting, and 
be mentored by industry-leading venture capitalists. In this positive light, the 
recruiting task seemed easy.
Excited about his new role and freshly graduated from college, Josh took 
the lead on recruiting the new team. Initially, Josh anticipated that recruiting 
should take about half of his time, leaving the other half of his time open for

business development. Conventional entrepreneurial wisdom suggested that the 
Cooliris team should start the recruiting process by tapping their social networks 
for potential hires. Aware of the competition for great technical talent, however, 
Josh developed an incentive to motivate his extended social network to proffer 
the best technical candidates: Cooliris would pay $1,000 for a candidate recom-
mendation that led to a hire. Josh soon flooded his own extensive social network 
with the news about the exciting opportunity to join the Cooliris team. Similarly, 
KPCB and the entire Cooliris team reached out to their social networks to find 
the best potential recruits available. At the same time, Josh recognized that the 
Cooliris team might not know or have links to all the best technical people. To 
fill this gap, Josh also searched online databases such as LinkedIn and Google, 
looking for technical talent at similar companies using search terms such as “3D 
graphics engineer.” Finally, Josh posted advertisements on LinkedIn and the San 
Francisco Bay Area edition of Craigslist. 
Over the course of the next few weeks, Josh’s search effort yielded mixed 
results. Not surprisingly, tapping the team’s social networks produced the best 
leads. Searching for candidates on LinkedIn and Google also produced candi-
dates, but not at the caliber the team desired. In contrast to searches, advertise-
ments on LinkedIn and Craigslist typically produced subpar candidates. Later, 
Josh discovered that the reason the ads proved so disappointing was because 
candidates with significant talent ignored ads in general; these candidates were 
already receiving good offers through other channels. 
In the end, after an exhaustive initial search, Josh reviewed over 1,200 
resumes in search of the ideal team. Of the resumes browsed, Josh reached out 
to potential hires who he estimated had at least a 50% chance of being an “A 
player.” Once Josh had filtered through the initial list of resumes, he then reached 
out to candidates via an introductory email explaining the Cooliris opportunity 
and the team’s interest in the candidate (see EXHIBIT 1 for the text of a sample 
email). In total, Josh contacted 400 candidates via email to invite them to talk 
more with Cooliris.
In the end, the Cooliris team brought in 50 candidates for a first round inter-
view. Because the incubator was located behind the main KPCB office, it was 
a little difficult to find. Furthermore, the doors to the incubator were always 
locked. To solve this problem, Josh gave candidates instructions on how to drive 
around to the back of the building to where the incubator was located. He told 
candidates to call once they arrived so that he could personally meet them and 
show them into the Cooliris offices. 
At the beginning of the interview, a candidate would sign a non-disclosure 
agreement after which either Josh or Soujanya would give the candidate a ten-
minute outline of Cooliris’s vision and the products that had already been devel-
oped. At the same time, because the company was in stealth mode and had some 
very high potential ideas, Josh and Soujanya were careful not to reveal too much 
about the future direction of the company or some of their upcoming products. 
Therefore, in a typical interview, after a brief presentation about the company, 
the interviewer spent the rest of the hour screening the candidate for his or her

technical ability. Josh and Soujanya also experimented with interviewing candi-
dates by themselves or with the entire team.
After a thorough examination of the candidates’ abilities during the first 
round, the Cooliris team decided to invite nine candidates back for a final round 
interview. The final interview lasted at least two hours and focused on a deeper 
technical discussion. Although the Cooliris team was still evaluating the candi-
date for fit and talent, in the final round interview the Cooliris team revealed a 
little more about the exciting future of the company. Lastly, the interview always 
included a long chat with Soujanya about expectations. In particular, Soujanya 
believed that it was important to have open and clear communication about the 
potential upsides as well as the risks involved; otherwise, both the candidate and 
the Cooliris team would be entering into a relationship under false pretences—a 
bad start to any relationship.
Of the nine candidates who received final round interviews, the team 
decided to extend offers to five high-potential candidates. Josh and Soujanya 
carefully crafted the offers to be as financially competitive as possible, bench-
marking against what Google might pay for a similar position as well as giving 
candidates potential upside through equity in the company. It now seemed that 
Cooliris could finally add needed resources to the skeleton technical team who 
had already been stretched to the maximum.
Two Unanswered Questions
Then came the surprise. Despite the apparent excitement that candidates exhib-
ited during the interviews, of the five offers extended, four offers were turned 
down. Fortunately, the fifth candidate verbally accepted the offer before depart-
ing for a long-planned trip to Europe. Although the yield for his efforts seemed 
slim, Josh felt that if they could at least hire one candidate then the last few 
months would not be wasted effort. Indeed, recruiting had taken an immense 
amount of time—much more than the 50% of his time that he expected. He had 
worked late nights, weekends, and holidays, all in an effort to succeed in build-
ing a technical team.
In the end, though, even the fifth candidate decided not to join Cooliris. 
Shortly after returning from Europe, the candidate emailed to say he had sec-
ond thoughts and decided he would pass on the opportunity. The candidate’s 
retraction came as a shock and led Josh to reflect seriously on the failure of 
the recruiting process. What had the last two and a half months been about? 
Why had he failed to build a great technical team? What could he have changed 
to make the process successful? And finally, the most challenging question of 
all, could it be him? Was the problem that he lacked what was needed to be an 
entrepreneur? These questions plagued him, but, on another level, Josh realized 
their challenges boiled down to two key questions. First, who is actually an “A 
player” and second, how do you attract those people to join your team? Soujanya 
peeked over the rim of Josh’s cubicle and with his usual earnestness suggested 
that Josh get some rest: “Hey Josh, it’s okay. Let’s talk about it in the morning.”

APPENDIX    Cases580
Josh nodded in agreement, grabbed his bag and headed for the door. The entire 
weekend was blocked out for the team to meet and discuss what had gone wrong 
in the recruiting process and what, if anything, could be changed. As he headed 
home, Josh wondered what he should suggest at the meeting. Were the team’s 
standards too high? Should they hire whomever they could find to help? What 
was the problem? Why couldn’t they recruit world-class team members?
Questions
1. You have just raised your first round of financing and want to build a team 
that can innovate in a completely new area: how would you go about iden-
tifying the right candidates and striking a balance between ingenuity and 
experience? Where exactly would you search for them? How do you suc-
cessfully attract your top choices to join your venture?
2. Make a list of what Cooliris is doing right and doing wrong, if anything, 
with its current recruiting process? How should they improve it?
3. How should recruiting processes differ for hiring various functional posi-
tions in this venture? For example, do the same rules apply to hiring engi-
neers as sales and business development talent?
EXHIBIT 1: Email to Potential Candidates
Hi (candidate name here), 
I took a look at your profile and you are definitely the kind of guy that we 
would like to work with for our startup, Cooliris. To give you context, we’re 
leveraging 3D graphics to build an immersive media environment for brows-
ing web content (check out our downloadable app at www.cooliris.com). We’ve 
recently raised Series A investment from Kleiner Perkins (the same investors as 
Google, Amazon, Intuit etc.) and are working with people like Bill Joy (Chief 
Scientist at Sun Microsystems) and Randy Komisar (former CEO of Lucas Arts). 
We’d be willing to explore both full time and contracting options with you, 
although we would greatly prefer people open to full time. Would you be inter-
ested in chatting further? 
Sincerely, 
Josh Schwarzapel 
Cofounder and VP of Business Development
