Chapter 1: Why Coaching?  We’ve had people ask us why we put so much emphasis on professional coaching skills for Agile coaches. In this book, we attempt to give you insights into both the why and the how. We are passionate about this topic because we have experienced the positive impact that utilizing these skills has had on our clients. We recognize that Agile coaching utilizes a broad skill set and incorporates expertise and experience.  We will not place a heavy focus on technical, mentoring, training, facilitating, or consulting skills in this book because these topics are well covered by other authors. We recognize and validate their importance and for the purpose of this book, we wanted to highlight the one that we believe needs the most attention in the industry overall, coaching.  All these disciplines, experience, and expertise are required to coach Agile organizations in the adoption of Agile ways of being, thinking, and working. We also recognize that underneath the Agile expertise and guidance lies the heart of the issue: cultural transformation. In our experience, to make sustainable change in organizations you must work in partnership with your clients to help them create the change they want. Consulting is an aspect of Agile coaching. Training, mentoring, and facilitating are also aspects of Agile coaching. In this book, we attempt to place the emphasis on professional coaching because our experience has proven that this area is the most misunderstood. In fact, it is the area that many don’t know exists. It is our belief that if you are going to function as an Agile coach, you should fully understand the competency area that is prominently displayed on your title: Coach. Cherie, “Let me start with a first-hand account of how embodying a coaching mindset and behaviors has made a more sustainable impact. I began working with a client that already had one Agile coach on site. He was leading the engagement and was making good progress. He had the favor of the top leaders in the organization, and they trusted him. The client decided to add a few more coaches, so things could move along faster. As is my custom, when I arrived on the scene, I spent a few weeks getting to know people and just observing how things were done in the organization. I noticed some interesting patterns across teams. There were several things that showed up as mirror images across teams. Of course, this in and of itself wasn’t too big of a deal. People share best practices all the time, so it’s not unusual for organizations to have multiple teams doing some of the same things. After seeing the pattern repeat itself multiple times and asking a few questions, I was able to put the pieces together and identify which teams were working with the original Agile coach and which teams were not. It became obvious to me that the coach must have a heavy hand in deciding how teams would do things. Then, I noticed the coach would often say things like, “(x person) is uncoachable.” He also mentioned that when he deemed someone uncoachable, he would go to their manager and tell

them that a person wasn’t complying with coaching. Thus, the manager would discipline the employee and instruct them they had better listen to the coach. This was interesting and seemed contrary to my normal way of working. At about the three-weeks into the engagement, I quietly slipped into a team’s Daily Scrum being conducted in a conference room. I noticed the team was standing up around the conference table looking at their electronic Scrum board displayed on a large monitor. Several of those who saw me walk in began to look at me a bit nervously. I just smiled and encouraged them with a nod to ignore me and keep going. After they finished with the Daily Scrum, they looked to me for input. Since it was their daily Scrum and I was still new, I didn’t really see much to add. They were collaborating and seemed to have a plan for the day. I wondered why they were all standing around the table, but I let it pass, since many people have picked up the industry’s “stand-up” terminology and feel a need to stand up even when it isn’t adding value. Then, it happened. The moment when the world I had stepped into began to make sense. Someone said to me, ‘Wow, I can’t believe you didn’t say anything.’ I shrugged and said, ‘There didn’t seem to be any major issues with what you were doing, so there really wasn’t anything to say.’ Their response was, ‘If x coach had walked in and saw us looking at our board with this filter we would have gotten in trouble. He would have scolded us and then went and told our manager that we weren’t listening to him.’ I remained non-reactive and asked, ‘Well, what makes you not use the board with that filter when he isn’t in the room?’ Their response, ‘It doesn’t give us what we need to plan properly. This filter is how we need to see the information.’ After hearing this, I simply responded, ‘Well, it seems to me that you should use this filter if it’s the one that adds value.’ I worked with this client for a year alongside the other coach. We approached things very differently. At our core, we had the same beliefs about Agile and how things could be done more effectively. We simply had different ways of approaching our work. He tended to be more consultative and dictative in his approach. He identified things that were wrong and gave instructions to make corrections. He took on the responsibility for the change the client wanted to make and, as a result, his success was based on forcing fast compliance with the rules. I chose to take a coaching approach to my work. I let the responsibility for making changes remain with the client. I tended to ask more questions and give fewer dictates. I certainly shared information about things that might be more effective. Whenever I did, my standard way of doing so was to add my thoughts to the ideas they already had and allow them to utilize those ideas as they saw fit. If I thought a group was making a decision that had risks or impacts that concerned me, I would ask questions to help them uncover how they would deal with those risks. Occasionally I would even say, ‘In my experience, I haven’t seen this solution work out well for others. I don’t think it’s the best option for you.’ If they decided to move forward with the option, I supported the experiment and got curious whether it would work out for them. Sometimes it did. I also spent some time training new team members and new team startups. I started working with the individuals and teams who had been labeled ‘uncoachable’ because I knew these were the people who were not interested in simply doing what they were told. These people were ready for change and wanted to make changes that added value and made sense. I wanted them to stop being seen as ‘uncoachable’ because I didn’t think it was a fair assessment. I mentored employee Scrum Masters to be coaches and challenged them to allow their teams to be both self-accountable and responsible. Rather than trying to take control, I

challenged the Scrum Masters to release control and ask questions that allowed the teams to think outside the box rather than simply following orders. This way of working really resonated with team members. Soon, Scrum Masters and the teams began taking chances, experimenting, and getting noticeable results. I’ll be honest and say that I was not revered by the other two coaches working with that client. In fact, I became so disliked by them that one of them gave me a verbal thrashing and stopped associating with me. The other simply refused to even look at me when we passed one another in the hall and didn’t speak to me the last three months I was there. Why? Because I wasn’t forcing compliance. From their perspective, I was allowing things to roll backwards rather than pushing it forward. From my perspective, I was moving slower and creating a more sustainable impact by allowing the client to decide for themselves how they would improve. Shortly after I left the engagement, something interesting happened. The leader of that organization decided they were doing so well, they called the ‘transformation’ a success and released the coaches. They also determined that since they were doing so well, they no longer needed Scrum Masters. Those teams who had been allowed to make their own decisions and grow organically started being forced to do things they saw as not valuable and, in their words, ‘not Agile.’ Within a year, all the most talented people I had worked with left that organization after long careers, stating, ‘They brought Agile to us, and it was the right thing to do. Now, they are taking it away and expecting us to go back to the way things were before. We simply don’t believe in that way of working anymore and can’t do it.’ These people had changed their mindset. They each said that they had changed the way they think about how work should be approached, and it had changed who they were from the inside out. They had adopted Agile values and principles into their core value system. They believed that a collaborative, cross functional, self-accountable work environment was the best way to work. These people had become Agile thinkers and refused to think any other way. That’s what sustainable change looks like. Others in the organization who had been under a more dictative approach had only changed behaviors. So, going back to the way things were relieved some pressure.”  This is just one of many examples where we were able to see the impacts of how we work with client’s side by side how others work with clients. It is true that working from a coaching stance does not create fast change. However, it does have a stronger likelihood of creating lasting change. Forcing behavior change can be a fast way to gain compliance and can gain favor with organizational leaders. It also creates a vanity metric around how fast things are changing. What is important is not how quickly things can start changing, but how sustainable the changes are. If a company hires an Agile coach for six months and that coach gains fast traction through strong force and threats, compliance may come quickly. This creates a scenario where the coach becomes the forcing mechanism that is holding all the change in place. However, when the coach leaves, the forcing mechanism, the coach in this case, is removed and much of the change generally rolls back. If the change rolls back, that company has just invested large sums of time and money with no sustainable results. They may bring in another coach and repeat the process or they may simply say Agile doesn’t work and give up.

It has been our experience that a much more valuable investment for an organization is to invest a year of time and resources to work with someone who takes a coaching approach. Improvement will likely happen in smaller increments. Experiments will be done to help find the right solutions. People will make changes and then go back to what they are used to until they see the value they were getting with new methods. Momentum will build and what will start to slowly build up in force will keep moving after the coach leaves because the organization itself is the forcing mechanism for change. Michael, “In the fifth week of an engagement, after watching another Agile coach provide consulting advice, I asked the management team, ‘What job has your organization hired Agile coaches to do?’ The other coach had some success initially. He had been telling the management team what they should be doing and how they should be adopting change. Eventually, he ran into trouble because the management team was not aligned on its business goals. He had simply not asked enough questions to fully understand the client’s needs and culture to give the cookie cutter advice he offered. When that coach used the same approach working with teams, they found the consulting advice overwhelming. On one occasion, a Scrum Master cried for 20 minutes while listening to the coach tell her how she should be doing her job.  I asked management what they wanted Agile to do for them. They replied they wanted to run more product experiments that would lead to quick successes. They believed this would help them to get additional funding from their strategic partners. I suggested and helped them put together a workshop based on Lean Startup ideas. The VP of Engineering took ownership and ran the workshop, and I happily let the client drive. Team members found the ideas shared in the workshop riveting, and they quickly collaborated on developing small experiments they could immediately execute. By running these experiments, they learned more about what their strategic customers wanted. And no one shed a tear.” When a coach leaves an organization, the changes should not roll backward. Compliance is easier to install and often takes hold quickly. Sustainable change takes time and effort to gain momentum. We wrote this book because it is our belief that Agile coaches should be working with clients to bring sustainable change. We believe that a coaching mindset is critical to sustainability. Many Agile coaches work from a consulting mindset and don’t necessarily have a full understanding about how a coaching mindset can be critical to making change at the organizational level. In this book, we hope to bring that knowledge to the industry. Why Your Company Need Agile Coaching, Not Management Consulting   Perhaps you are the person at your company who is on a mission to make improvements, so you are reading this book to understand what an Agile coach can do for you. As your company thinks about who it wants to partner with on its agile journey, it has probably considered hiring a management consultant. Common wisdom dictates they’ll help you move faster, work better, and find the perfect solution to streamline your process. But all their long hours and sleek

PowerPoints won’t solve your problem long-term. Because much of what management consultants do is for show.  In a very revealing article for Harvard Business Review1, Professors Alaric Bourgoin and Jean-Francois Harvey points out all the ways consultants essentially “fake it ‘till they make it.” They rely on shared industry knowledge to sound like experts. They stay late and arrive early so you think they’re working harder than you. And those “million-dollar PowerPoints” with clean lines and actionable solutions are most likely upcycled from previous clients.  Although Bourgoin and Harvey note this behavior as a hazard of the consulting profession, that still hasn’t changed the fact that it’s a $256 billion industry focused on treating the symptoms of a business issue as opposed to addressing the source of the problem. The invitational approach to Agile coaching that we describe in this book, on the other hand, seeks to increase the capability of an organization to solve its own problems. Where consultants enter a situation and immediately begin dishing out solutions, commands, and advice, an agile coach works with the company to identify the root of workflow problems and improve flexibility. Most importantly, agile coaches want to put your people at the helm of change — not an outsider.  Michael, “As an agile coach for more than 10 years, and only 1 of about 150 Scrum Alliance Certified Enterprise Coaches in the world, I’ve seen first-hand the dramatic difference our approach can make.”   By valuing your people as your greatest asset, you’ll create long-term, actionable change that promotes exponential growth for your business. But for this to work, businesses need to be willing to function in tandem with an agile coach and not expect the consultant experience. Otherwise, both sides will experience a catastrophe.  So, before you leap into a new Agile coaching session, here are a few things you should consider: First, Agile coaches work with pre-existing needs instead of creating new ones. As a business leader, you don’t need to be told how important change is — you already know. And yet, a management consultant often strives to stir up a sense of urgency around change. This old-school line of thought was led by John Kotter, a big name in business theory and management consulting. Kotter always said creating urgency was the first thing you should do when working with a company. But in reality, “creating urgency” is based on fear. For example, maybe your team would benefit from improved workplace dynamics, tightened workflows, or simply finding better ways to communicate.  No amount of standing over people’s shoulders and telling them to change (“with urgency”) is going to solve the root of any of those problems. Instead, good Agile coaches tap into pre-existing desires. They don’t step in and say, “This is what’s urgent.” They listen and ask, “What

do you want to improve?” And more importantly, “How do you want to improve it?” Then, and only then, can you and your team find the most efficient way forward together. 
Second, Agile coaching removes the middleman, helping you foster strong internal relationships. Few people will volunteer themselves for conflict, so it’s tempting to have a consultant step in and do all the talking for you. Michael says, “I was recently working with a Senior Vice President (SVP) who was going through this exact scenario. He hired someone who would talk with his teams, report back what was said, and then make recommendations. I couldn’t believe he refused to speak with his team directly.”   
What happens in a communication funnel like this is it creates a parasitic relationship. An outside influence is all of sudden needed to communicate with your team — and without it things may fall apart. You lose your power as a leader. Instead, the management consultant runs the show. And that’s not the way to win big. 
The best wins come from the people in the company. Remember: your people are your experts. They already know best; you just have to get them to talk to you. A2 good Agile coach can help push the right buttons and open the right channels to start the necessary conversations without getting in the middle. 
Third, Agile coaching puts people over profits by any means. For the greatest success, your company needs to value people as humans. 
We’ve all seen how massively a company can fail if they don’t. Valeant Pharmaceuticals3, for example, was under fire for gouging drug prices — they upped the cost of a vital prescription to 5500% of its original cost in a single night. They’ve since endured major rebranding to shake off all the scandal.

They brought on McKinsey management consulting. The problem with agencies like McKinsey is they’re most interested in companies that make money at whatever cost. They aren’t in tune with the way the world is moving — valuing human agency over treating people as disposable. 
Conversely, a human-centric approach inspires and values true innovation. 
Agile coaches can help companies understand where their ethical boundaries are, and then operate in a way that honors them. By feeling valued and needed, teams will feel more capable of disrupting the world around them. Without that sense, they may feel like just another cog in a machine. And cogs rarely lead to innovation. 
By listening to your people, needs, goals and challenges, Agile coaches help you to create the best solutions internally. We facilitate but don’t dictate, allowing you to innovate the way you’re meant to. This keeps companies growing and functioning, without the need for a consultant six months down the road. In fact, our goal as coaches is to never see you again — we have nothing to gain from your failure. And that may be the biggest difference between a consultant and a coach — true investment in your success. 
Chapter 2: The Coaching Mindset The magic of a mixed drink comes from the variety of different ingredients. You get a little of this, a little of that, and a bit of another thing, all blended to create the perfect cocktail. While this concept may be great for crafting amazing drinks, it’s not the way to conduct an amazing professional coaching session. The magic of professional coaching comes from sticking with a single, solitary ingredient: coaching. You don’t mix in a little consulting, a little advising, and a batch of rules and regulations you insist clients follow. You need to stick to straight-up coaching without watering it down if you want your clients to reap the greatest rewards and success. A quote from one of the founding members of the International Coach Federation (ICF), Marcia Reynolds that Cherie and Alex captured during a podcast4 with Tandem Coaching sums it up neatly: “The notion of Hybrid Coaching dilutes the value of coaching. When you mix mentoring, advice giving and leading people to what is best for them into what you call coaching, people come to expect the easy way out. They look forward to you telling them what to do. This might be

helpful, but if coaching is what they really want or need, they're mis-experiencing this powerful technology for creating breakthroughs and growth.” Agile coaching, on the other hand, is intended to be a mix of disciplines. Each discipline has power to bring to the engagement. The question is: Can the Agile coach exercise enough self-management to be in the discipline the client needs and, when shifting disciplines, do so effectively and purposefully? It is our opinion that to effectively switch between disciplines, an Agile coach must understand and embody a coaching mindset. The Coaching Mindset The coaching mindset is not only a way of behaving when you are conducting a 1-1 or team coaching session. Many people can “act” like a coach, utilize coaching skills, and even conduct a good coaching session that checks all the boxes. Coaching skills can be taught. A coaching mindset must be developed purposefully. Many people have coaching skills. However, knowing how to coach doesn’t make you a coach. The thing that’s critical to have a coaching mindset is the ability to see the client as competent, resourceful, creative, and not in need of fixing by the coach. When you look at people as fully able to exercise their talents, skills, experience, and expertise to make decisions, you treat them differently. What we have witnessed in our experience working with clients among other coaches is that those who have a coaching mindset treat the client as an equal. Those who don’t have a coaching mindset often treat the client as if they are subject to the coach.  Much like the coaching mindset, and Agile mindset is a way of thinking, believing, and behaving.  What we have noticed in our experience is that Agile coaches who have an Agile mindset are more likely to have a practical application of Agile rather than a dictative application where everything in the book must exist. An Agile mindset is a mindset that embodies the Agile values and principles and thinks in a way that is collaborative, focused on results rather than processes, and is empowering. When you put this way of thinking differently about how to approach work together with a coaching mindset that sees people differently, everything about the way you engage changes. Think about it this way. When you work with an organization, and they adopt Scrum, Kanban, or some other discipline the first thing they, and many Agile, coaches think about is following “the rules”. They make sure the teams are having the right meetings. They make sure the teams are creating backlog items a certain way. They make sure the teams are right sizing the work. None of these things are incorrect. However, they are all external actions and can be done with no real change occurring in the organization.  Cherie, “In my experience focusing only on behaviors often results in people not changing the way they think about how they approach work. If they don’t know the why, or the behaviors aren’t solving a problem then they go through the motions. If people believe their jobs or performance reviews may be negatively impacted, they will comply if they can keep moving forward. I’ve often witnessed managers who will say, “Sure, fine, we’ll do it this way if it makes you happy.” Then, when an emergent challenge comes, they default to their habitual way of

thinking and do what they’ve always done. Because they haven’t changed the way they think about work and decisions, they just go back to the same way of making decisions that they know works.   Now, let's bring this back to coaching skills. When a coaching session is going well, it’s easy to focus on following the coaching arc, asking questions, and giving the client space to think through their challenges. However, when the session isn’t perfect it’s the coaching mindset that keeps the coach in the proper stance. If you don’t have a coaching mindset, coaching behaviors are a fine idea, but they are not convenient when you have seen the client’s problem before, and you “know” what they can do to solve it. Coaching behaviors don’t seem important when you believe that the client should take certain actions if they want to be successful. Moving them forward, so you can add value to the engagement is what will seem most important at that moment. However, it’s the coaching mindset that enables you to self-manage. It enables you to carefully consider if stepping into mentoring or consulting is what’s best for the client long term. Sometimes it is important to make a shift and help the client understand something they genuinely don’t know that is vital for them to move forward. However, what we’ve seen more often is that it is not what the client needs, but what the coach needs that drives the coach to step into consulting or mentoring. The coach needs to feel like they are adding value. Sometimes they need to prove their expertise. Often, they just want to escalate the timeline to seeing changes happen in the organization. However, the question of success isn’t how quickly an organization can install new behaviors. The question of success is how sustainable are the changes? Agile coaches often talk about “individuals and interactions over process and tools” then focus on process and tools. Perhaps they focus on interactions because those are easily seen through behaviors. But how often do we really focus on the individuals? Professional coaching has a concept: coach the person, not the problem. At first glance, this concept doesn’t fit into Agile coaching. Let's be honest, companies hire us to install Agile and fix the problems they are having, so they can get business results. To do this sustainably, it is important to help the client focus on the problem, so they can take ownership of the changes they want to make. However, the Agile coach needs to focus on the client. Most decisions and actions clients take are temporal experiments. The decisions and actions are not as important as how they went about determining that the decisions and actions were the most appropriate. If you focus on the client's mindset you will focus more on the values and principles of Agile than the best practices of Agile. This will enable them to make good decisions that keep them in alignment with the way they want to see their organization work. By learning to think like an agilist, their behaviors will display Agileness. Forcing them to do Agile behaviors will not create Agile thinking. To develop a coaching mindset, there are a few key shifts in thinking that must occur. Competent — Not broken or in need of being fixed

This may very well be the most important concept in this book. It underlies the coaching mindset, determines how you see people, and reinforces the decisions you make about how to work with clients at that moment. “Seeing people as competent was a core aspect of the mindset that enabled me to move to a place of mastery and effectiveness in coaching,” says Cherie. “A coaching mindset moves beyond the coaching conversation and becomes a part of who you are. You see people differently. And, because you see them differently, you interact and react differently. The coaching mindset enables you to be curious instead of arrogant.” Cherie, “Whenever I do any coach training, there is a powerful exercise I do. I ask people to take a moment to reflect on and discuss these two questions, 1) What will be different about my interactions if I genuinely and authentically believe that every person in the organization I am coaching is completely competent and don’t need me to fix them? 2) In what ways have I been judging the people in the organizations I’ve coached to be incompetent and need me to do things properly?” Our challenge to you is to reflect on these questions and do some soul-searching. Are you seeing the individuals in the organizations you coach as fully competent? Or have you judged that some of them are broken and need you to tell them how to change? If you are up for a challenge, we invite you to look around at other parts of your life. Who are you seeing as not competent to make their own decisions and be responsible for their actions? Perhaps it’s a partner who approaches life differently than you do. Could it be a parent who doesn’t understand technology and trusts you enough to ask for help? Maybe a teenager or a younger child that you feel compelled to protect, so you won’t allow them to make mistakes and learn valuable lessons they will need later in life.  Your ability to trust in the competence of other people is at the pinnacle of allowing them to take ownership and responsibility for what they want to change and what they don’t. When you can trust that they are competent to take control of their own life, profession, and company you will be able to trust them to decide what changes they will undertake now, and which will be deprioritized. It is only when you trust in the competence of the teams and organizations you coach that you will model self-organization. Until then, you will insist that people self-organize within the boundaries you give them. When you believe your client is competent things shift. When you notice something happening that seems completely off base, you will react differently. Have you ever rolled your eyes when seeing a process, the client is following that just doesn’t make sense? Have you gotten frustrated because even though you’ve talked about it at length, the client keeps saying they will do one thing and keep doing something else? Have you gotten a bit angry when seeing how a manager or team member is acting? Perhaps they are blocking progress or not allowing the others to function properly in their roles. Perhaps their command-and-control behavior is triggering you to want to march into their office and tell them how hard they are making things for everyone else. We all have these moments, and these are all symptoms of not seeing the client as competent and of you being triggered to “fix” them.

What happens differently if you see your client differently? When you see these same things happening, instead of being triggered to react, you will get curious. When you know the client is competent, you also know that there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for what’s happening. If this process was put in place, there must have been a problem it was instituted to solve. You will start to ask questions to understand the problem. You will ask how the current process is working for them and if there’s anything about it that isn’t working. Instead of deciding for them that they must change the process, you will help them examine the process and decide for themselves if it needs to change. Creative and resourceful — not in need of rescuing Supporting clients to reach the outcomes they seek begins with a true partnership. You not only need to believe that your clients are competent. You also need to believe that they are creative and resourceful and can figure out the best next steps for themselves, their team, and their company. If we believe this, we will leave our superhero cape at home and trust the client. The challenge we face as Agile coaches is the thing that also sets us apart and makes companies hire us — our experience and expertise. Masterful coaching in an Agile environment doesn’t mean that we leave what we know at the door, that’s not partnership. There is more to Agile coaching than just showing up and asking questions. And there’s more to Agile coaching than showing up teaching everyone how to do their jobs. You must know more than Agile to be an effective Agile coach. You have to experience working with broken Agile repeatedly before you can understand the challenges clients face when trying to improve.   That experience enables you to empathize with what the client is experiencing. No one comes to work every day hoping to fail. People want improvement. What they need from their Agile coach is to be able to understand and empathize with the client and partner with them to figure out how to remove the barriers to success. Keep in mind that clients need empathy not sympathy. Empathy connects with what the client may be experiencing and gives validation and acceptance. Sympathy feels pity for the client and expresses a belief in the client’s brokenness. If we think the client is broken, it will impact our ability to work with them to create sustainable change. If they are broken, and you fix them, the client will grow dependent on you to solve their problems. You might get lots of recognition and appreciation for helping them, but this is not in the client’s best interest. For them to create sustainable changes the client needs to take ownership of making the change for themselves. This is how they learn to think through the challenges they face and make educated decisions about how to overcome them. Your goal as a coach should always be to ensure that the client continues the work after you leave. Showing concern for the client is not the same as worrying about the client. Concern communicates that you care about the client and want the best success for them. It communicates that you are all in and a full partner in doing the work. It builds trust with your clients when they know you support them.

Worry, on the other hand, expresses that you want to somehow fix the client’s problems if given a chance. It expresses that you can fix the situation when you believe your client can’t. Worry will cause you to push your own ideas, solutions, and agendas on the client. Worry drives you to put on the superhero cape and tell the client to step aside because you have the answer to their problems.  Safeguard against falling into this type of codependent relationship with the client. Codependency from an Agile coaching standpoint means you think the client needs you to be successful, and the client thinks they need you to be successful. Neither of these beliefs are helpful, and they certainly are not true. “A simple way to tell that you are falling into the ‘worry’ trap is to monitor how you communicate with other Agile coaches,” says Michael. “If you find yourself saying ‘If they just did x all their problems would be solved’ or ‘They need to do x to be successful’ that probably means that you’ve put on your superhero cape.” Please also take note that what we are recommending is not merely an external facade. You must intentionally cultivate this belief into your way of being. It goes beyond a single coaching conversation or encounter. Look around the Agile community. Who are you putting on pedestals? Whom are you dismissing? Instead of seeing people as stack ranked, see them as human. All deserving to be seen as creative, resourceful, and unbroken. If you can do this successfully, you will find brilliant people in the community that you can mentor to become even better. You will also find that people you thought you would mentor, actually mentor you. You will experience that those you turn to for mentoring will learn from you too. When you can cultivate the belief that humans are humans and should all be treated as valuable, you will be able to support any client. Clients need to trust that your support is genuine before they can express the truth of their situation without worrying what you might think. Cultivate the belief that your client is creative, resourceful, and unbroken. Become fascinated with what others might find shocking. Allow yourself to accept the client for who they are with all the things that are part of that package. Don’t dismiss things the client says and assume they are non-relevant. Instead, become curious about why the client is sharing this information with you. Consider how it is all part of the bigger picture. When clients trust you, they will tell you what you never expected to hear. Learn to control your responses. Learn to take it in without the judgment reflex taking over. See information shared as data for the client to work with rather than data to be sorted, analyzed, and judged by you. Cultivate a habitual reaction of curiosity rather than shock, defensiveness, or judgment. Cherie, “I learned to control the shock, defensiveness, and judgment reactions by becoming acquainted with my internal physical happenings when these responses are triggered. Each time I felt the trigger, I immediately checked my facial expression to ensure neutrality. I checked to make sure I was breathing normally. I relaxed my face, cleared my mind, and just listened. I reminded myself to be curious and to suspend judgment. Doing this repeatedly outside of coaching conversations helped condition my mind and emotions to detect and respond to the physical trigger. Focusing on building this ability makes it an instinct now during coaching

conversations. Remember, you can’t control triggers. You can control how you react and respond.” Equal — not better than or less than If you really want to be a masterful coach, cultivate the belief that you and your client are equal partners. You might have more experience and expertise in some areas and that’s what you bring to the table. They have different experience and expertise and that’s what they bring to the table. Trust that the client is the expert of their own business. They know the intricate details about the operations, the personalities, and the company culture. Therefore they should be making the decisions about what will work and what will not. Your salary, job title, reporting structure, etc., do not place you above staff and below executives. All are to be seen as equal partners. If you can’t see your clients as equals it will cause you to look at some people as not as competent as you are. Clients can feel this, and they also see it in your behaviors when you treat people with differing levels of respect, care, and patience. If you see executives as more important than you, it will hinder your ability to be straightforward with them. You will hold back because you don’t want to upset them. This is not helpful for the client. If they hired, you as their coach they see you as equal already. Treat staff with the same level of respect you give executives and give executives the same level of challenge you give to staff. Everyone will benefit.   
Chapter 3: Developing a Solid Foundation  Developing a Solid Personal Foundation You wouldn’t build a house on a foundation of sand, would you? You’d want bedrock beneath the structure to keep it standing strong, stable, and balanced. A solid foundation also helps stop the house from shifting, the floors from buckling, and the walls from eventually cracking or even collapsing. Building a home on a foundation of bedrock is a common understanding, yet some of us may overlook our foundation as we’re zipping through life. You may run from one client to the next, putting their needs above your own to keep your business booming. You may put self-care on the back burner, thinking it’s a nice option — or a luxury — not a necessity. Nothing could be further from the truth.  If you keep up such a frenetic pace, what eventually happens? You crack. Collapse. Have a breakdown. This can be especially true in the enterprise coaching realm, where you are regularly meeting with high-stakes clients with equally high demands.

When you give it your all — without the benefit of a solid personal foundation — you are going to run out of things to give. You’ve heard it on airplanes all the time. Don’t try to help anyone else with their oxygen mask until you’ve put on your mask first. That oxygen mask is the personal foundation that keeps you going. Building one is more than just a good idea. It’s the only way to live if you want to be able to give your best every single day.  How do you begin to create a foundation that keeps you strong, stable, and balanced? That's what this chapter is all about. Daily Practices Build Strong Foundation Establishing daily practices that contribute to a strong personal foundation requires a combination of self-awareness and courage. The self-awareness part is covered by knowing what makes you tick. What nourishes you? What’s good for you? What do you need to do for yourself regularly?  Figuring this out entails a deep dive into you. You need to determine what is needed for you to thrive. Not what society says you need. Not what your partner, parents, or neighbors say you need. You are the only person who can fully understand what you need to have a stable foundation. You are the one who determines what creates just the right amount of balance in your life. Once you pinpoint habits and lifestyle practices that keep you going, the courage portion of the equation kicks in. Knowing what you need is not enough. You must regularly implement those things and not let life disrupt your self-balance. This can take a lot of courage, especially if what you need is not aligned with the typical way of doing things. Just ask Cherie. She says, “Society tells us we should be working from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., with a few short breaks and maybe lunch in between. I don’t work well in the morning. My brain just can’t seem to focus. I also don’t like going to sleep at what most people would consider a reasonable hour. This means that waking up early in the morning to start working at 8 am leaves me tired and sleep deprived. However, I do work well from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. I excel at detailed work at night when there are no distractions, and my brain is firing on all cylinders. To keep a sustainable pace, I need to do what works for me.  So, I keep the hours that work for me. I schedule my client calls to start later in the day, take a break 5-7 pm then often work until the early morning hours. I sleep in until I naturally wake up in the mornings and take a nap when needed. This works well for me, so I ignore what society demands and care for myself in the way that is best for me.”  Knowing yourself and breaking free of society’s rules that don’t suit you. That’s the epitome of courage when it comes to building a solid personal foundation. It’s crucial to make your own rules, based on what you need to maintain a sustainable pace. Michael says, “Meditation and breathwork sessions are essential parts of my daily routine. I do 20 minutes in the morning and another 20 minutes in the afternoon. I schedule extra sessions when I start to see warning signs that I’m losing my sustainable pace. Signs like insomnia, increased stress levels, and talking to myself. I immediately turn to meditation and breath work to get me back on track.”

Other daily practices include journaling, exercising, and eating right. You need to model a sustainable pace if you’re going to recommend it. So, integrate what you preach into who you are. You can’t support others if you’re not supporting yourself, and this involves constantly nourishing your body, mind, and soul with what you need to thrive. Large client bases and high-stakes clients require enterprise coaches to spend a lot of time being at their best. Since we can only give from our abundance, it’s imperative to keep our abundance flowing. Cherie says, “I am very intentional about my calendar. I block out mornings, no work until at least 10 am, so I can wake without an alarm clock. I block out time off and when I’m busy I block my calendar to receive any more appointments for 1-2 months at a time. I also schedule doctor, dental, hair, nail, and massage appointments for the entire year. This prevents me from having to struggle trying to find appointments at the last minute. It reduces stress and prevents me from taking on too much work. I also block off weekends as no appointment days and often spend most of Saturday and Sunday relaxing and resting, reading fiction novels, and letting my body heal itself. This sabbath keeps me in good mental and physical balance.” What Happens When We Falter? Regardless of how self-aware, courageous, and disciplined we may be, we’re still human. That means we’re bound to fall out of our stable, balanced, and healthy zone from time to time. What happens then? We all have the signals that let us know when we’re not at our best. We have to recognize when it’s happening. Cherie says, “When I get tired, I tend to be less filtered. I get more easily frustrated and have less patience for other humans. As a result, I end up blurting out things that can be harmful. I know that means I need to invest in some self-care practices and to sleep more.” Michael says, “I know I’m off-balance when my ego gets involved, or I become afraid or angry and then lose neutrality. I may become defensive, start lashing out at others and draw attention to myself. That’s exactly what the ego wants. I know right there I need more self-care, more daily practices keeping me at my best.” When we’re in balance, it’s easy to be generous, compassionate, and kind. When we’re not, we revert to less healthy behaviors and habits. The quicker we can realize we’re off-kilter, the quicker we can remedy it. This helps keep damage, to us and others, to a minimum. That is exactly why self-care comes first. This is the opposite of what most of us have been taught. In fact, the messages we often get are that self-care is a weakness, although because of the courage it takes to run counter to cultural norms, it’s a sign of both wisdom and strength.  Once we begin to more easily recognize when we’re off-balance, we can look at how we got that way. What have we done, or not done, leading up to the imbalance? What behaviors are you doing that you don’t like, and what circumstances led up to this? Knowing what road led to the situation can help us recognize it even earlier, to change course before we’re more deeply entrenched in behaviors we’d rather not exhibit.

Cherie says, “I have often found myself getting a bit overwhelmed in a situation, then shifting into blaming mode, getting frustrated, and being very abrupt in the way I communicate. One day, after such an episode, I apologized to my son, a teenager at the time, for my behavior. In his wisdom, he was able to see a pattern that I was so entrenched in that I couldn’t see it for myself.  He explained a part of my behavior that I would never have understood without him. He expressed total acceptance of my poor behavior and said, ‘It’s okay mom. I know that you get frustrated when you are confused. You don’t mean any harm.’ Because of his insight into my reactions, I can now recognize when I’m starting to feel overwhelmed, and stressed, and it reminds me to stop and ask myself what I am confused about. This helps me to not act in a way I’ll have to apologize for later.” The key here is to watch yourself operate, to note when you’re slipping out of balance, and why. Run your mind and emotions in “debug” mode. When you’re deeply engrossed in a situation, it can be challenging to witness your behaviors as a neutral observer. That’s where you can ask for help from a friend or fellow coach. They can step in to point out the behavior, and even help redirect the situation. Michael says, “I tend to get upset when clients don’t understand what I’m saying. I can end up raising my voice and blaming the client for not getting it. Once I was co-coaching with a friend. When this happened during the engagement, my friend would step in and take over the conversation. This was perfect. It gave me time to step back and regroup before I made a challenging situation worse.” Consider getting a coach, working with a coaching supervisor, or asking a friend to help. Like self-care, asking for help is another sign of strength that’s pegged by society as a weakness. It takes a strong and courageous person to recognize the need for assistance. And when it comes to mental health, there is no shame in taking care of your mental health the same way you should take care of your physical health.  Once you recognize you’re off-balance, you may want to pause for an appropriate amount of time. This timeframe could be quite long, as our brain chemicals need to calm down. After we’re back in balance, it’s time to follow-up with additional actions. Apologize if needed. If you hurt someone or acted in a disruptive way, an apology can help correct the situation. An apology also acts as a sign of acknowledgement that you were out of line, which is much more connecting than simply ignoring the incident as if it never happened. If you find yourself apologizing often, it may mean that you need to become more aware of your thoughts and triggers, so you can build different responses and habits. This is great work to do with a professional coach. It is important to also be aware that it is possible that this is an indicator that there is a deeper issue that may be more suitable for counselling than coaching. The aftermath is also a good time to journal. In addition to helping, you manage anxiety and reduce stress, The University of Rochester Medical Center notes that journaling allows you to track day-to-day signs, so you can more easily recognize triggers and create ways to more effectively control them.

Journaling can also help you notice patterns of behavior that crop up again and again. If you notice you keep apologizing to the same people for the same thing, the goal is not to keep apologizing for what you continue to do. That’s using an apology to cover up a dysfunctional behavior instead of changing. The goal is to stop doing it. Tracking your habits and behaviors can shed light on why a particular behavior keeps occurring, and what you can do to stop the behavior from repeating itself. Another trap that you can fall into as a coping mechanism when you’re out of balance is to stop caring, to practice stonewalling. You might use it to anesthetize. You will step out of the situation, true. But if you don’t step out to regroup and return, you will step out of the conflict to avoid it. Then, you may continue to go through the motions and collect your coaching fees, but because you are in the self-protective mode, you will no longer provide the level of support your client needs and deserves. Perhaps even worse, you will no longer be true to your own values. Strengthening Emotional Intelligence “Emotional intelligence is the ability you have to be smart about your emotions,” writes Professor of Psychology Leslie Riopel in an article published at Positive Psychology. Another Psychology Today article adds that it can be viewed as the ability to identify and manage your own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. The framework for emotional intelligence, or EQ, is divided into four areas. They are: ● Self-awareness ● Self-management ● Social awareness ● Relationship management 
 From: https://positivepsychology.com/emotional-intelligence-frameworks/

People tend to naturally have different levels of emotional intelligence, but the good news is that it can be developed and strengthened.  EQ is a set of skills that can be built upon over time. The first step is to determine how much emotional intelligence you currently have. Start by learning more about it. Take an assessment. See where your strengths and weaknesses lie, so you can maintain the former and build on the latter. Working with a friend or fellow coach can also come in handy here, as they’re more likely to notice when you are behaving in detrimental ways concerning your own emotions and the emotions of others. You can find EQ assessments across the web, such as the Emotional Intelligence 2.0 assessment. In our opinion, assessments that have a 180 or 360 component are more effective because when a person lacks emotional intelligence it’s hard for them to assess. Comparing their own assessment of themselves to what others say can often provide the outside perspective needed to see the impacts we have on others. Cherie uses the Genos Intelligence 180 and 360 assessments for clients who wish to receive coaching to improve their level of emotional intelligence.  Michael says, “When I began learning more about emotional intelligence, I had a blinding insight. It was that you can’t control other people with your emotions. That means yelling at someone doesn’t help you. Once I realized this at the cognitive level, I had to let the lesson sink into my heart. That was followed by trying out the new behavior and getting used to it — and being okay with feeling uncomfortable and failing. Strengthening my emotional intelligence made me feel more solid, more comfortable, more grounded. It makes other people feel safer.” You’re not going to snap to a high level of emotional intelligence just because you want to or feel you need to. You have to work at it consistently. It can be hard work. It can be uncomfortable work. But the results are worth it. When your emotions are out of control, you become unpredictable, behave poorly, and end up feeling scared and judged. Other people are also scared, as they don’t know how you’re going to react.  Any issues with emotional intelligence in the enterprise coaching realm can be especially damaging. A coach that is out of control emotionally will learn, rather quickly, that it can sever the client relationship in an instant. After all, if you cannot control your own emotions, how are you going to help teams of senior executives? People need to be able to trust you if they are to be open to coaching because the position of the client brings a lot of vulnerability to people who may not be used to being vulnerable. The higher up the corporate ladder your clients are, the higher the stakes are for them and the more emotional intelligence you must exercise when working with them. Self-Discovery Builds the Foundation One final and extremely important pillar in building a solid personal foundation is embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Knowing what you need, and desire is the only way you can be sure to fulfill it. There are many ways to engage in self-discovery. Cherie often tells people, “My journey to becoming a professional coach was life altering. During coach training I received so

much coaching and had so many mindset shifts that by the time I was finished I was totally different. This is the power of coaching. I still utilize coaching and find it very useful to keep self-discovering and becoming the best version of myself possible.” Cherie, Michael, and Alex have all found the well-known book “The 5 Love Languages5” and its partner book focused on the business world “The 5 Language of Appreciation in the Workplace6” by Gary Smalley helpful in uncovering and discovering emotional communication preferences. These books outline five different ways people express and receive love, acceptance, and appreciation. Not only can you determine your own appreciation language, but you can also learn how to use it to connect with others to create the most meaningful and fulfilling relationships. Journaling is once again a useful tool for self-discovery, as is ensuring you listen to your heart. You need to discern what needs and wants are coming from your heart, and not from a head that’s been fed with societal messages its entire life. As noted earlier, what you need and what society says you should need are often two very different things. Don’t be ashamed of what you want — or who you are. Don’t judge yourself or your desires, labeling things as “good” or “bad.” Be easy on yourself. Be kind to yourself. Treat yourself the same way you would treat a friend since you are not likely to judge or belittle them for wanting or needing something that’s different or unique. A question that often arises here is how do you know if your desire is a heartfelt desire and not a vice? Let’s say you want to blow off steam gambling in Las Vegas on your next vacation, betting your entire paycheck for the thrill of it. How do you know if this is something you need to do to maintain a firm personal foundation or a vice you’re drawn into? One way to determine between a vice and a desire is to do a spot check by thinking long-term. For the long term, is betting your entire paycheck in Las Vegas something that is likely to end up helping or hurting you? Is this something you feel in control of and can plan without bringing harm to yourself, your profession, and your family or is it something that controls you that you will later regret? We are responsible for all our actions and the results they bring about, both externally and internally. If your actions are likely to cause hardship and grief for yourself or those around you, it may be wise to think twice about proceeding. Self-discovery also means living in alignment with your values, something you can only do if you know what they are. Self-discovery may sound like hard work, and it is. But it is nowhere near as difficult as living day after day, month after month, not knowing what you want and need, or even why you’re doing what you’re doing. It’s challenging to consistently grow and succeed if you’re not sure of your higher purpose. Once again, the benefits of all that hard work will be worth it. Michael says, “It unleashes an enormous amount of energy and flow when I’m in tune and in harmony with my higher purpose. There’s no internal resistance. I am swimming through  5  https://www.amazon.com/Love-Languages-Secret-that-Lasts-ebook/dp/B00OICLVBI/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=5+love+languages&qid=1633324878&sr=8-1  6  https://www.amazon.com/Languages-Appreciation-Workplace-Organizations-Encouraging-ebook/dp/B07F7NYY9P/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=appreciation+languages&qid=1633324934&sr=8-2

life, no longer running through rocks. I am passionate about what I do, and it’s a passion others can see and feel. It makes them excited, too.” Michael uses a technique called his personal reflection worksheet to monitor his state over time. He also uses it when building new relationships to give people an overview of who he is and how he operates.  His personal worksheet contains the following categories:  ● Style: Use this section to jot down your known personality traits and behaviors ● Values: Write down just a few things that you find the most important ● Growing edge: Try to describe the main behavior or emotional trait you would like to work on right now ● Kryptonite: Even Superman had a vulnerability ● Common emotional state: Simply take note of the way you usually feel ● Preferences for receiving assistance: Similar to knowing your appreciation language, figure out which kinds of assistance have proven most beneficial to you. ● Personality tests: We find it worthwhile to explore personality through a variety of personality tests Michael’s Personal Worksheet Example

In summary, to support organizational transformation, an Agile coach benefits from having a deep ‘root’ that keeps them always grounded. One of the greatest gifts that a coach can give to others is to not operate out of fear or frustration. Doing so requires an exquisite sense of self awareness and deep self-understanding as well as a profound ability to continually do one’s own work. We hope that some tools and approaches in this chapter will be helpful to you in becoming more connected to yourself. 
 Chapter 4: Developing Coaching Values  Developing and living your core values as an Agile coach is more important than certifications. Certificates generally indicate that you took a class and received some learning. Learning is important. What is more important is that you can integrate what you learned into the work you do. We are not discouraging certifications and continuous learning. We are discouraging taking class after class and never implementing the learning received. What we are talking about is building competency. Agile, as an industry and an approach to work, is much more of a “state” than it is a destination. It’s not just a way of improving efficiencies within an organization or streamlining communication between team members. Agile is, in fact, a way of being—and a dedication to the process of always looking for ways to improve yourself and those around you for the greater good. This means Agile coaches must be just as committed to that same learning process. Part of the competency of being a masterful coach knows the values you live by. We expect our clients to know and understand the values and principles of Agile and believe that if they are adopted the client will be successful. It is our opinion that Agile coaches should also have a set of values they live by that describe the belief system their coaching derives from. It sets an expectation for what the client will experience when engaging with the coach. And it gives the coach a foundation to work from and always return to when they get off base. The Importance of the Coach’s Value System One of the most under-discussed aspects of Agile coaching is the importance of personal values. This is the difference between “being” and “doing.”  Some coaches only focus on what they do in a client engagement: their value proposition, project goals, timeline, costs, etc. These include their competencies, skills, degrees, books they’ve read, courses they’ve taken, masterminds they’ve attended, and so on. And all these things define and “speak for” our skill level. However, they do not give very much insight into who we are as human beings.

The underlying qualities that do speak about our humanity are our core values—many of which are arguably just as important, if not more important than our core competencies. These are the fundamental habits, perspectives, traits, personality quirks, and soft skills we bring to every engagement. Cherie is sharing and describing her values here as a jumping off point to inspire you to reflect on your own value system around how you engage with the world as a coach. However, your values may look very different. Your coaching values are specific to you and not something anyone else can give you. Developing a set of core values isn’t meant to be an exercise to create a pretty pie chart that you put in a file and never see again. It is intended to be a reflective activity that grounds you in who you really are and who you want to be. Determining and committing to your coaching values can be a career impacting experience. Committing to these values that declare who you are as a coach can be a defining moment in developing your coaching mindset. For Cherie, this became a declaration to her clients that told them what to expect from a coaching engagement with her. The values became the mantra for how she embodied coaching. Cherie says, “I use my values to stay grounded and to have the courage to do the hard work. When I’m tempted to take over the change for the client, I reflect on my values of leaving no trace and empowering. When I get frustrated, I reflect on my values of doing no harm and seeing the client as competent and whole. When I have a challenging conversation, I reflect on truth telling and being the mirror. When I’m tired, and I want to give up, I reflect on my values of engaged neutrality and letting passion guide. These values always remind me of who I am and how I do this work.”

 Leave No Trace: This means that when I work with an organization, though the impacts of my presence can be seen in the outcomes they achieve there isn’t a visible imprint of my presence that someone can come behind and say, “Cherie Silas must have been the coach here because she always …” My goal is to honor the client and partner with them to design the right solutions for them. Not to implement some framework that might one day make me famous.  One way that I prevent leaving a trace is to refrain from implementing “best practices” or “common practices” that are part of a checklist for what each client should adopt if they want to “do Agile.” Instead, I honor each client by finding out what their specific problems are and by working with them to discover how they can best change and improve. I believe that we cannot apply simple solutions like “best practices” to complex problems. When we have the type of complex problems that show up in large systems, the best way to approach them is through experimentation and learning through trial and error. Only the client understands their situation well enough to truly design the best experiments and decide which new ways of working they want to adopt. If I engage in honoring this value, the client’s imprint and not mine that remains in the organization long after I have faded away. My role as the coach is always to facilitate discovery towards success rather than implement prescriptive ways of working.  Do No Harm This value means that when I am finished working with a client, they should be better off because of their experience working with me. I strive to ensure that people are better when I leave than they were when I first encountered them. This means that I must be invested in their success and not focused on my own. If I push my agenda on people, I will also push them to make decisions that may not be right for them. To force my agenda would be to do harm.  My goal is to honor the client’s expertise in their organization and circumstances and be a partner that provokes them to flourish. Another way that I do no harm is to always remember the power I hold in my professional opinions. Yes, there are times I give my professional opinion, but I always communicate that these are just that — my opinions. These opinions may not perfectly fit within the context of their organizational culture, so the client must take control of their destiny. There are no generic right answers to every problem because the truth is, it depends on all the details I can’t possibly know. Because of this, I am careful to not throw around opinions that make me look like an expert. Instead, I ask questions to help both me and the client to understand more about the situation and the outcomes they hope to achieve. I ask questions that will help them understand the impacts of the decisions they make. And when I do give a professional opinion, I do it in a way that keeps the client in charge of their destiny. I can’t change their company for them. Nor do I want that responsibility. If I were to start

taking ownership of their changes, I would surely harm the organization because I don’t have to live with the consequences of those decisions. My preference is to give information that helps inform the client’s decision and then support them in the decisions they make. If they decide against my recommendation, I must trust that this is the right decision for them at this point in history. At some point, if it becomes apparent to them that they have made a wrong decision, I partner with them to shift direction. Competent and Whole Seeing my clients as competent and whole is what enables me to be in full partnership for their well-being and success and neutral when it comes to how they accomplish their goals. During every moment I work with any client I must be able to see them as competent and think, “They can knock it out of the ballpark! They have the capacity for greatness.” They may not have the same skills set as me and there may be some knowledge or experience, I have that is different from theirs; but, this doesn’t mean they are not competent. Rather, it means that we make a great partnership because we both bring different strengths to the relationship to work with.  I must always consciously believe that my clients are not broken so I am not tempted to fix them with my own solutions. Even if the systems they set up in their company seem strange to me, it doesn’t mean I need to fix them. My role is to partner with them. I’m not above them, and I’m not beneath them. I walk alongside them in partnership, and we figure out together what they would like to change or improve and design experiments to find the right answers. On occasion, when I find myself wanting to fix or save a client from their challenges, this is a big red flag for me that I am not holding neutrality in our partnership. When this happens, I must self-reflect and make the proper adjustments to see my client from the right perspective. If I cannot see my client as whole, complete, competent, and unbroken then I have an ethical obligation to recuse myself from being their coach and to recommend a more suitable partner. Be The Mirror As a coach, it is not my role to assess and determine what’s broken in my client’s world. It is also not my place to decide what they need to fix or how. My role is to understand the goals they want to achieve and share my observations, intuitions, concerns, and what I notice from a systemic perspective. I am not able to make judgments on these things or to tell them if or how they should change them. I am there to reflect to them what may be obvious but also needs to be made transparent. This allows them to determine if they want a change so we can work together to determine how they want to bring that change into reality.  One example of how I become a mirror is to reflect to my client how it tells me it sees itself. When I start work with an organization, and at periodic intervals during the relationship, I survey the organization to understand how it views itself. I meet with people from all roles, all levels, and functional areas to hear what themes arise from them about what they are doing well and about things they can focus on for the change to be more successful. This is not an assessment where I am determining if they are “doing Agile” correctly. This is an exercise on hearing how

the system sees itself. I do this by listening to hear the recurring themes that arise. Afterward, I reflect on these themes back to the organization to see if what I heard resonates with them. If it does not, we talk about those gaps and identify if there is a misalignment in parts of the organization or if I understood incorrectly. We use the output of this exercise for the organization to select improvement items and to create a plan for how it wants to move forward as we partner to achieve the success, they design for themselves. TruthTeller This is my commitment to myself and to my clients that reminds me to courageously say what needs to be said when no one else will. When I first engage with a client, we have a conversation about how the client, and I will work together. I generally ask questions like, “When I have an observation that might be a bit hard to hear, what is the best way to approach you with that information?” and “How challenging would you like me to be during our work together?” My experience has shown me that no one wants to tell the leader a truth that might upset them. However, not having the person in your life who will speak frankly and who cares enough to risk the relationship for your best interest can stagnate your ability to be successful and to grow.  People need this information to understand what’s holding them back. As their partner, I commit to always speak the truth, even when it’s not the popular thing to say. When people hire me as a coach, they can be sure that they will hear the truth spoken with professionalism and kindness and I won’t back down from hard conversations. The point here is not to win or to have an argument about how I think the client needs to change. The point is that I am in partnership with them to help them achieve success the way they define it. If I am in partnership, I will not withhold observations that bring transparency to process, behaviors, actions, inactions, conflicts, etc., happening in the system. It is only with transparency that a system can inspect and adapt properly. Without true transparency they can’t inspect what needs to change, so the adaptations made will never truly solve the problems manifesting in the system. By modeling courageous conversations that make truth visible, the organization can learn the benefits of transparency, inspection, and adaptation. Engaged Neutrality As a coach, I must help my clients focus on their definition of success. I must believe in them, be in their corner fighting for them, celebrate with them, and be sincerely invested in their future. At the same time, I must let them be in control of the path to get there. I will walk with them on the path and offer challenging support to the decisions they make. I will design experiments with them and give them my perspective to consider. But what I will not do is step out of a neutral position when it comes to where they want to go and how they will get there. These choices are theirs. As a partner, I respect their ability to be the expert in their own life and company, so I will not try to force my ideas or agendas on them. My commitment to my clients is to be fully engaged in their success while maintaining a neutral stance. I uphold their goals, dreams, values, and reflect to them what I see and hear. But I don’t try to influence them to follow my ideas or vision of what success could be for them. When they

are not acting on the decisions they make or improvements they commit to making I help them get perspective on the why. I don’t “hold them accountable” for not doing what they said they would do. Instead, I probe into how they are getting in their own way. I help them to re-envision where they want to go and how they want to get there. I partner with them to design a more suitable accountability structure where they can be responsible to enforce their behaviors. It is not my role to hold them accountable. It is my role to hold accountability up to them for them to examine and determine the next steps.  Empower This value causes me to remember that I will not allow a client to become dependent on me. I refuse to be in a situation where people think they need my permission to act, or they need me to decide for them. I don’t want that kind of power in people’s lives. And that’s not a sustainable model. I want to leave behind a sustainable culture and way of working so that people can continue moving forward in the direction we started long after we stop working together. Coaching should leave people empowered with a new way of thinking, a new way of sorting through decisions, and a capacity to see things from new perspectives. If I am working at my best with my clients, they will learn how to work independently of me, so their accomplishments do not roll back when I’m no longer in the picture. My goal from the beginning must always be how they will operate when we have finished our engagement. I want to leave a legacy of independent success that they own and can take credit for creating. Let Passion Guide This value focuses on me and how I make decisions about what work I will say yes to and what work I will say no to. It is important to me that I only do work that brings me personal fulfillment, passion, and energy. If I take an assignment that I am not passionate about I will not be fully invested in the work. My heart will not be in it, and I’ll be miserable the whole time I’m working with the organization. When my full passion is not engaged, I am not the best coach I can be for my clients and that’s not the coach I want to be. This means that I will not accept work just because it is paying work. I must resist the temptation to allow worry or fear of not making it financially drive me to accept work that isn’t the right fit. Instead, I must trust that if this is the work I am supposed to be doing, and I’m making an impact then the right work will come, and I will be financially stable. If I take a client because I need money, but it’s not the right fit, this violates my ethical standard because if I do this, I will enter the relationship for my own needs and not serve the client’s needs. Benefits of Defining Coaching Values These are Cherie’s core values, and we fully recognize that each of these will not resonate with everyone. Rather than adopting her core values, we encourage all coaches to think about their own core values, write them down, and refine their list over time. Understanding who you are as a coach and how you want to show up is more valuable than getting another certification, reading another Agile coaching book, taking another training course, or going to another

conference. It is great to add to your knowledge and gain new skills, but not at the expense of avoiding the most important part: discovering and defining what makes you, you. After all, clients don’t hire your certifications, tools, and knowledge. They hire you.  Here are some of the benefits that come from the hard work of defining your core values as an Agile coach. They will: ● Help guide client engagements ● Help you to be intentional about who you are when you interact with clients ● They serve as a grounding point for when you get off-center ● Allow you to make more self-aware decisions ● Reveal who you should work with—and who you enjoy working with the most ● Encourage and foster more meaningful collaboration ● Create consistency in how you interact with clients and increases trust ● Increase your credibility as a coach because you live what you speak ● Improve your coaching presence and the impact of your presence on your clients  Take some time to think about your values concerning how you serve clients. Make them conscious and explicit. We all inherently have our own set of values. We often aren’t aware of the values we adhere to because we haven’t reflected enough on them to put them into words. Take time to reflect, write them down and say them out loud. It may take a few weeks or even months to fully solidify the values you hold about coaching. Some values will change and emerge over time. It’s important to capture them and consciously bring them to the forefront. Once you understand the value system that drives your work, you can intentionally make choices that don’t violate them. This will give you a more fulfilled career and make you a better coach for your clients. There’s a quote with unsure origin that says, “The way you do one thing is the way you do everything.” If you can’t take the time to pinpoint the underlying values that make you a trustworthy and credible coach, then what does that say about your ability to help your clients do the same? You will have clients that need to understand and clarify their personal values, team values, organizational values. If you have done the work for yourself, you will be better able to partner with them. Here’s a simple method to discover your core values: First, imagine a time when you felt fulfilled and accomplished. Second, imagine a time when you were unfulfilled and unproductive. Without overcomplicating things, these two scenarios can become the variables you always want to move toward and against. What circumstances make you feel fulfilled? How are you when you feel accomplished? What do you want? What environment brings you the most joy, and why? Similarly, what are the circumstances when you feel unfulfilled? What is usually happening when you feel unproductive? What things frustrate you? What will you not tolerate from yourself and others? What situations do you not want to relive?

The answers to these questions and others become a blueprint you can follow to align yourself with your most fulfilling and honest work. This investigation can help you define what makes you feel alive and whole—and what causes you stress, sparks conflict, and ultimately leads to an unfulfilling situation. This personal discovery will enable you to say to your potential clients and employers, “This is who I am and how I work with clients, and I want us to both be clear on what a relationship will be like between us.”  Personal Accountability  Now, once you’ve settled on your core values, here’s how to keep yourself accountable: Share your core values with your clients, so they know who to expect to show up as their coach. Michael likes to share his values in proposals, so they are clear up front. Periodically throughout an engagement, take some time to think about how well your core values are being displayed in the work you are doing. Cherie says, “If I’m feeling particularly grumpy or frustrated by an engagement, I’ll ask myself specifically whether I am honoring my core values or not. ‘Am I censoring myself? Am I not being a truth-teller? Do I feel like I have to be a different version of myself in this environment?’ In general, when I’m not happy working with a client, after reflecting a bit, I realize that there is some violation of my core values happening. This is a time when seeking coaching supervision can be extremely helpful.” At the same time, when a client asks, “Do you want to extend our contract and continue working together,” this inner-questioning process is just as important. “Have I been able to be my true self? Have I been able to be true to my values? Am I enjoying the work? Do I believe there is still more impact I can make?”  Cherie shares, “At times, I have chosen not to continue working with a client simply because the arrangement did not align with my core values and what, and I knew I would not be fulfilled doing the work.” Don’t wait until later in your career to begin taking your core values into account. When you are first starting in the business, there is a lot of focus on just landing clients. You are focused on generating new business and proving that you are competent at the work you’ve been hired to do. If we aren’t intentional, we will lose ourselves in the shuffle. We’ll take on engagements only for the money or experience, and we’ll be miserable in the process. Our mental health will suffer, our relationships outside the office will suffer, and our physical health may be impacted. It’s worth it to consider the contracts you take closely. Make sure they work for you and not just for the client. To be clear, we are not saying that hard skills and core competencies should not be a priority. What we are saying is that your competencies and values should be pursued on parallel paths. You are not just on a path of career advancement, but also one of self-discovery. “I can say, for

myself, my values have changed over the course of my career as an Agile coach. I value different things today than I did five years ago, or a decade ago. And so, as time goes on, it’s my responsibility to continue checking in with myself and redefining my core values as a professional. This allows me to make more conscious decisions about whom I want to work with, and why,” says Cherie. If you don’t understand your values, you may very well spend years and years at odds with yourself.  For example, in many corporate environments, leaders understand that the way to success is “pushing” people—pushing, pushing, pushing. Cherie reflects, “I don’t enjoy doing that, nor do I believe it leads to the most effective result. So even though there are a lot of clients who would be willing to pay me lots of money to push, push, push, those engagements would force me to abandon one of my core values. I would be at war with myself. And that internal friction would end up causing problems for me, and the client. In every new client relationship, my primary goal is to ensure the work I am doing is being done alongside these core values. Otherwise, I am letting the client, and myself down. 
Chapter 5: Engaged Neutrality This chapter dives into the concept of neutrality, exploring its nuances and its importance as part of the underlying foundation for any successful coaching relationship. Neutrality refers to the ability to remain objective, without promoting your own viewpoints, or pushing your opinions on the client. Neutrality in coaching does not mean communicating in robotic, emotionless, or monotone methods. Neutrality isn’t about being disconnected from the client. It’s about being unattached to your own opinions about how the client determines they want to move forward. When you slip out of neutrality, you are likely slipping out of coaching mode. Sometimes that means you are taking on the role of a mentor or consultant. You might even be stepping into the role of the Agile police. As an Agile coach, it’s fine to intentionally step over into these other roles, however when working from a coaching stance, you should hold your opinions lightly. Give the client your perspective and then let them decide what’s best. If a coach remains neutral, does that mean they don’t care? No. There is a big difference between neutrality and apathy. A state of neutrality allows you to be okay with whatever direction the client decides to go. You care about a client’s success, but you don’t force them into a specific direction for achieving it. Neutrality is not about being lax or indifferent, either. We need to be as fully invested as our client, but we don’t take ownership for their change. We hold the process — the client owns the content. They will live with the outcome of their decisions, we won’t. Whatever course they want to take or the outcome they desire is what matters, not the course we think they should take or the outcome we would desire. It’s imperative for coaches to take a neutral stance on the methods your client uses to achieve success on their goals. You want to acknowledge the work they are doing to move forward, and you want to do so without approving or disapproving of the steps they decide to take. Working in

neutrality means that you refrain from judgment and instead use curiosity. Judgment isn’t only in a negative sense. We can judge something to be a good idea or a good next step. The problem with judging things as good (or bad) is that it exerts influence over the client. It puts the coach in a ranked position over the client. This might cause the client to respond to our reaction as advice to take a specific action. If we influence the client to take specific actions or decisions, we are taking responsibility for their change. For the client to make a sustainable move forward, it must be on their own terms. When working with teams/groups of people neutrality means that we must not give an impression of taking sides or picking one idea over another. We can’t react to one idea saying, “That’s a great idea!” and not acknowledge others the same way, or we will send the message that we have selected one idea to be more viable than the others. What we can do instead is to acknowledge that the idea has been given to the group and ask the group for more ideas or for their reaction to the idea. When working with organizations it is sometimes particularly hard to maintain neutrality and not take sides. Keep in mind that when we hear one person tell their side of the story, we can become biased. We can also be triangulated in the middle of someone else’s conflict. It’s important for us to show empathy for what people are experiencing. However, showing sympathy by joining sides with them can create more harm than good. Cherie recalls, “I can remember working in an organization where staff members were telling me stories about how a particular manager was acting. I got really frustrated with the manager’s described behavior and started getting angry. I can remember wanting to yell at them and say, ‘What are you doing?’ Then, I realized that I had moved far from neutrality. I had chosen sides instead of remaining in a neutral position that would have been more helpful for the staff and manager to resolve the conflict. I moved into the savior role and wanted to tell the manager off. I also judged the manager based upon third party information without even speaking to him to understand his perspective. And I moved into a superior position thinking that I had authority to force the manager to change the behavior. It was this incident that helped me to realize that if I truly saw my clients as competent, creative, resourceful, and unbroken I would get curious instead of angry in situations like this.” If neutrality sounds like a challenging thing to achieve, that’s because it can be. The human brain is wired to make automatic judgments about other people’s behaviors. That’s how we quickly assess a situation without spending exorbitant amounts of time or energy trying to understand everything we encounter. But when you’re in the role of the coach, you want to use self-management to short-circuit that automatic judgment process. Instead of automatically labeling something the client says or decides as “good” or “bad,” take a neutral stance. It is not the coach’s role to decide if what the client says is good or bad. From the coach’s perspective, everything should be simply data for the client to work with to gain more awareness.

Maintaining neutrality gets easier the more you pay conscious attention to your thought process. Yet it’s not always something that can be achieved. If you’re not able to maintain neutrality regarding your client, it may be a good time to work with a coaching supervisor to discuss the work you are doing to figure out why. A supervisor can help you to reflect on specific client cases that are challenging, so you can get new perspectives on how to interact more effectively. Michael recalls, “I had an individual client who reached out for coaching because he wanted to lose an extraordinary amount of weight in a rapid-fire amount of time, something like 30 pounds in a month. We spent about an hour exploring the possible actions the client could take to achieve this goal. At the end of our in-depth exploration, I was not able to be neutral with respect to what the client was planning to do to lose that amount of weight so quickly. So, I had to recommend that he work with a different coach.” Not all cases of lost neutrality necessarily require terminating the relationship. It depends on the specific situation and if you’re able to regain and maintain neutrality going forward. In the weight-loss case, where Michael knew deep in his soul, he’d be unable to move forward comfortably with the client’s way of approaching success, a break was required. But in another case, when Michael found himself slipping out of neutrality, he was able to amend the situation, bounce back to neutrality, and continue the coaching relationship. “I recall one situation where a manager was not supporting the change work that was being done in the organization she led. She was not participating and taking ownership of the changes the organization wanted to see, and she was not offering support the teams needed to be successful. In my emotionally charged state, I remember saying: ‘The manager has abandoned her team.’ This way of thinking and judging the client is not aligned with a coaching mindset. The judgmental statement was an outward sign that I was not maintaining my neutrality. I was picking sides. I decided that the team was a victim, and the manager was a villain. This is not neutrality, and it is not helpful to the progress of the organization. While I was not able to maintain neutrality at that moment, I was able to get it back. I recognized the state I was in, and I reached out for help. Getting support from other coaches helped me regain a state of neutrality,” recalls Michael. Engaged Neutrality Being neutral doesn’t mean that you should be idle. Contrarily, your role is specifically to help the client to gain more awareness about multiple perspectives, options, and even risks associated with the ideas they bring forward. If a coach has opinions, does being neutral mean they can’t express them? While we certainly don’t want to force our own opinions or agenda on the client, we may share them if it feels right. We might have opinions, expertise, or experience that we add to the conversation in a brainstorming style, but it’s up to the client to decide the actions they take. Opinions can be expressed in a way that presents them as information, without attempting to sway the client’s own opinion.

We like to think of neutrality in terms of “engaged neutrality.” When working with clients, we should be fully in partnership with them and invested in their success. Being in full partnership means that we bring our whole selves to the relationship. We aren’t required to interact with our clients in monotone voices or ask only open-ended questions. There’s much more to coaching than that. As a partner in the relationship our full engagement shows up in multiple ways. Our personality comes through the conversation which helps the client build a personal trusted relationship with us. When the client shows emotion, we shouldn’t “maintain neutral tones.” We should match that energy and experience it with the client. Then, if that state is not helpful for the client, we can shift our energy, so the client can follow us to move into a more useful state. Being in engaged neutrality means that we are fully listening to the client, and we are mentally stepping back, so we can see the bigger picture and take note of what it looks like from a higher viewpoint. Are you noticing trends or behaviors in the client that might be useful for them to explore? If so, share that information with the client and let them decide what to do with it. Being engaged is noticing and sharing — neutrality is allowing the client the power to decide what to do with the information. Engaged neutrality means taking the risk of challenging the client’s thinking. Do you get the sense that the client is holding back? Tell them what you are sensing. Does it sound like the client is playing it safe? Tell them — challenge them to think outside the box. Is the client expressing limiting beliefs that seem to be holding them back? Challenge the beliefs. Ask them how they can look at the situation from a different perspective. Does it sound like they are making excuses for not doing what they know needs to be done? Tell them and ask them what’s happening. Engaged neutrality doesn’t mean standing by and watching while your client walks blindly off a cliff. Engaged means shouting, “Hey! That’s a cliff!” Especially in Agile coaching, we have a responsibility to our clients to bring our experience and expertise to the table to give them more information to make educated decisions. This doesn’t mean telling them what they must do. However, it does sometimes mean that you will tell them what you know from experience and ask them how they will ensure that the same issues don’t go unaddressed in their organization. When they say they are going to make decision X, and you get an uncomfortable feeling because you’ve seen that end up in disaster in the past, you have a responsibility to use your expertise. Let your expertise inform you on how to ask probing questions that cause the client to think about their situation in ways they didn’t know to think. This is being engaged. Then, after exploring the decision thoroughly with the client, neutrality is not trying to force them to change their mind because of your experiences. Trust the client to know their domain much better than you. Just because it hasn’t worked in your experience doesn’t mean it won’t work in this experience. Every environment is different and functions differently. What’s perfect in one place may be a complete failure somewhere else. Can coaches remain neutral while still suggesting methods to use to achieve an outcome? As with everything in Agile, the answer is, “It depends.” If you find yourself “suggesting” anything when the client has not specifically asked you for suggestions, you have already lost your

36 
neutrality. That doesn’t mean that at times you can’t provide examples of methods as information for the client to consider. Especially if they ask for them. Remember, it can be extremely frustrating to a client when they say, “How would you do this?” for you to answer, “How would you do this?” In fact, when leading a coaching organization at a large Fortune 500 company, this was the number one complaint about Agile coaches Cherie received from business units. “They never answer me! They just ask me what I would do!” Well folks, that’s not skillful coaching. There’s a skillful balance between making contributions to the pool of information and being afraid to interact with the client’s request for help. Cherie shares, “Generally I handle these requests for my experiences or expertise in a few different ways depending on the presenting circumstances. First, I remember that most of the time when people say, “What do you think?” it’s an unconscious stall tactic to give themselves time to think. So, I watch them. If they are thinking, then I remain silent while they think and start talking again. It wasn’t a real request for input. Second, if they are asking me something like, “What would you do?” I generally don’t have enough information to tell them what I would do. So, I think for a moment, then I say something like, “Well, tell me about this…” (notice I didn’t ask them, “Well what would you do?”) This way, my question is seen as genuine engagement. If they truly need advice/mentoring, then more information is needed. Most of the time, getting them to think in a new direction results in them being able to keep moving forward, and we don’t come back to hearing what I would do. Third, when the client really does need some ideas, I give them very brief thoughts with no detail and follow with a question like, “How would something like this work in your organization?” or I might ask them, “What ideas do you get from this?” Remember, even if the client asks for your expertise or experience, and you give it, hold it loosely. Clients don’t need to execute on your examples. Agile coaches will often be called upon to give consulting advice. This is part of the job and not off limits. However, when giving your professional opinion to the client it's important to remember that the client knows their domain much better than you. This is their company — not yours. Tell them what your opinion is. Ask them for their thoughts on how this might work in their company. Every professional opinion the Agile coach has will not be adopted by the client. And that’s okay. Partner with the client to adopt the things they are ready to move forward with and to inspect and adapt in areas where the client is not yet ready or able to move forward. Don’t forget to take into consideration that every client system has its own sets of complications. Just because something needs to change for ultimate success, it doesn’t mean that the client has the power to change it at this moment. To the coach, it might seem like one simple change. However, to the client that one simple change might represent hundreds of changes with multiple impediments to address. Clients need to be strategic. Agile for Agile’s sake is an unacceptable reason for a coach to suggest change. There must be a viable business reason why change is being adopted.  Coaching Presence and Neutrality Coaching presence refers to the ability to be fully conscious and create a spontaneous relationship with the client. Coaching presence is an interesting competency. It’s what you bring to the conversation and the relationship. When people interact with you, they need to feel

37 
honored and respected. Engaged neutrality is key to developing a safe, trusted relationship with the client that enables them to be vulnerable enough to discuss challenges and ideas freely. Part of coaching presence is being observant which means you’re going to notice things like a little smile or a light in the client’s eye when they mention something. Or you may note they are a little tense, stressed or repeating phrases like “I have to.” Neutrality allows you to curiously ask what their reaction is all about instead of automatically coming to a subjective conclusion that may or may not be correct. Coaching presence also requires being empathetic. This means you can relate to mentally take on the client’s perspective and understand how their experience is valid for them. This gives them permission to feel what they’re feeling without judgment. Neutrality allows you to relate to what they’re experiencing without tainting it with your opinion. You don’t have to agree with their viewpoint. Simply being able to understand and acknowledge their viewpoint is critical to the relationship. Asking reflective and responsive questions is dependent upon engaged neutrality because it allows you to maintain the client’s rhythm without trying to direct or manipulate the conversation. You and the client can dance with the moment, with the conversation flowing in a natural rhythm with the client driving. Neutrality allows you to remain curious about what you and the client are going to discover in your conversation. You’re not asking questions that are colored by your judgment or leading in a specific direction you feel the discussion should take. The coach is free to make contributions to the conversation, but they also need to invite the client to respond any way the client wants. This means not being offended if a client rejects methods, ideas or even observations you bring up. You can mention an observation you have, such as a client reacting to something with what appears to be fear. But you want to ask the client if that observation is accurate. “What’s your perspective on that? What comes to mind when you hear me say that?” You may be totally off-base. Even if your observation is on target, and fear is part of the situation, it’s not something you want to focus on unless the client chooses that focus. If a client doesn’t want to discuss a certain issue, a seasoned coach will know to leave it alone, let it go. Not return to it again and again just because the coach thinks it needs to be discussed. It only needs to be discussed if the client decides it needs to be discussed. Neutrality allows you to accept the client’s response, whatever it may be, without trying to prove to the client that you are correct. Coaching involves listening, paying attention, and asking questions — all while partnering with the client in the situation. You can help the client brainstorm possibilities about ways they might solve the problem and move forward, but you also want to draw some of those possibilities from the client. Part of the way a coach helps the client is to playback possibilities the client expressed. “I heard you mention three areas you want to focus on. Which one would you like to focus on first? How would you like to focus on it?”  Neutrality again allows you to offer the client power, choice, and ownership of the agenda.

Neutrality allows you to create space for the client to generate their own learning. You’re putting the information in the hands of the client. The client is the one who gets to decide what to do with that information. Remember that the client is completely competent. They can and need to do the learning in order to create sustainable results. What you’re learning about the client and what they’re learning about themselves may be different things. You don’t want to assume you are both learning the same things. Instead of saying something like, “I see that you’re learning XYZ,” you can say, “What are you learning about this?” Instead of saying something like, “Can you tell that to the manager?” you can say, “What can you do with this information? How can you use this information to make an impact?” Conclusion Hopefully by this point it is crystal clear why engaged neutrality is vital for a successful coaching relationship and what it looks like from a practical standpoint. The client is the one choosing the path they want to take and how they want to take it. They have honored you with the gift of partnering with them to witness their journey. Your job is to help the client think through choices and take ownership. You are there to support and partner with the client in a non-judgmental and helpful way, and that can only be done when you retain a state of neutrality. Chapter 6: Challenge and Support “I’m getting a bit frustrated with a trend I’m seeing in the Scrum Master and Agile community, and I think we need to do something about it. People seem to think that if they are coaching, they can only ask questions. Coaches feel helpless when their teams are heading off a cliff and think they can’t do anything about it. There’s been so much focus on asking powerful questions that coaching has been relegated to helplessly asking questions and leaves no room for challenge.” And with those words Allison Pollard7 summed up what many in the Agile community have experienced and frustrated with for years. These beliefs are a symptom of an oversimplification of what coaching with competency really means. It is also a confusion between coaching skills and coaching. There are many reasons this oversimplification has run rampant in the Agile community. Coaching programs that teach skills in a series of classes but require paying thousands of dollars for a tag-on program to learn how to competently use those skills. The fact that coaching is an unregulated industry, and anyone can call themselves a coach, with or without proper training. Even books like this one have contributed to the oversimplification because there is a huge gap between knowing about coaching and being able to apply that knowledge competently. We have seen repeatedly that people who have done some self-study can describe coaching perfectly. Then, when we have a coaching conversation what they do as a coach doesn’t mirror how they explain coaching. Why? Because coaching is a competency. To build competency, you need feedback from people with

tested and verified competency in that area who can guide you on how to utilize the skills appropriately. Part of competency as a coach is understanding that coaching is much more than asking what people often call “powerful questions.” The term “powerful questions” is very misleading. It gives the impression that a question, in and of itself, is powerful. That’s simply not the case. What makes a question powerful is dependent upon many factors. Was the question constructed well? Short questions that are open-ended and not leading are well constructed questions. Was the question transactional or transformational? Transactional questions seek data transfer from the client to the coach. They look at what the client already knows or has experienced and asks the client to transfer that knowledge to the coach. These questions are rarely powerful. Transformational questions cause the client to think and discover. They look at what the client has not already experienced and may not have given thought to. They create learning for the client and have the potential to be very powerful. However, there’s more needed for a question to be powerful than just the question. Otherwise, lists of powerful questions would enable everyone to have consistently powerful coaching sessions. Was the question responsive? Questions that coaches ask should be in response to what the client is communicating. If the coach is listening actively, the questions asked should resonate with the client because they focus on what the client is focusing on. And lastly, did the coach get lucky? Yep — did the coach get lucky? “What does that mean?” you may be asking yourself. “Coaching powerfully isn’t about luck!” Well, to some extent, yes, it is. You can ask well-constructed, transformational, non-leading, questions that help the client think and still don’t land so powerfully that the client discovers the huge realization they needed to move forward. That powerful landing is a matter of asking a good question, that happened to catch the client at the exact moment in time when they were able to make a connection that changed everything. The coach never knows when or if that will happen and neither does the client. That’s where luck comes in. This doesn’t mean that competency isn’t important, contrarily, competency is of major importance. Without competency everything is just luck. Competency creates the conditions needed for the transformational work to happen. Beyond questions, there are many other competencies that make coaching masterful. For example, being courageous enough to make challenging observations that help the client see things they are refusing to see. Using your instincts and intuition to challenge the client to say what they are not saying. Sometimes, even confronting the client with the lies they are telling themselves. Skillful Agile coaches will often find the need to challenge Agile teams in the ways they are thinking and decisions they make. These types of challenges can only emerge in a relationship where there is a high level of vulnerability and trust in both the coach and the client. Building that type of rapport with a client quickly takes a high level of competence. Strong coaching relationships have “healthy tension” between the coach and client. The question is whether the coach competently can create an environment of healthy tension where the client feels both supported and challenged. Clients may operate from deeply embedded

assumptions that they believe to be true — even when there is no proof. Offering both challenge and support can enable the client to dig in deeper to validate or invalidate those assumptions. Michael once had a client who was a business owner. The business owner consistently complained, “My clients always pay me late.” This was frustrating him and causing him to be discontent with running his own company. Michael challenged the client’s discontent with questions about the financial impact of the late payments. When they sat down and looked at the books together the client realized that his assumption that clients were paying him late had no basis. With more coaching, the client realized that he had been basing the belief on events from previous years when he had challenges getting timely payments from his clients. He was assuming that the current clients were also not prompt with payment. This misinformation in his mind was subconsciously affecting his interactions, performance, and overall attitude. Challenging questions helped him break free of the misinformation. It got him to think outside his rigid beliefs. Once he got a new perspective, he was able to be more flexible in his thinking. The best way to think about this is through the Healthy Tension Dynamic Model© created by Cherie Silas of Tandem Coaching.   The model is created by placing different scenarios in four quadrants (see below for image). On the Y-axis is “challenge,” and on the X-axis is “support.”

As you look at this model you must take into consideration that every client will experience high challenge at a different level. You can’t use the same amount of high challenge with everyone — some need more challenge and some need less. What is key is that you balance the level of challenge and support. So, if you are going to be very supportive of a client, you must balance that high support with an appropriate level of challenge. Otherwise, your client will experience care and comfort but won’t necessarily feel a need to make changes that will bring them closer to their goal. If you offer a high level of challenge, you need to balance it with a high level of support, or the client will feel beat up and unmotivated.  To get the balance right you must learn your client. Utilizing other bodies of knowledge and assessments like Gary Chapman’s Appreciation Languages can help you identify the level of support vs challenge the client needs. Tools like this are also helpful when coaching teams to understand how the system interacts with itself. For example, a client that is primarily motivated by “words of affirmation” may experience a challenge very differently than someone who is primarily motivated by “quality time.” This doesn’t mean that the “words of affirmation” client can’t handle being challenged. It does mean that they get more from a friendly, caring challenge than an “in your face” direct challenge. What this means for the coach is that they must develop competency in how to challenge clients effectively. This model doesn't describe the intensity of a challenge — your client’s needs should determine intensity. What it does describe is how to balance challenge with support and what happens when there is an imbalance present. Understanding this model can help you diagnose your interactions with the client and make the shifts necessary to provide the best service to your clients. Low Challenge / Low Support  In the model, this quadrant is described as “not coaching.” Technically, it could be coaching but at a very low skill and competency level. When people coach from this quadrant you will likely see low support manifest as not listening to the client. The questions the coach asks may be way off base and show a clear lack of connection to what the client is saying. The coach may be using a formula or technique and walking the client through without paying attention to what the client needs. The coach may even be using a list of questions and following a checklist, so they may be asking well-formed questions that seem to be disconnected from what the client is saying.  Low challenge might manifest as asking closed and leading questions. Providing solutions for the client. Not making observations. Taking what the client says at face value and not digging in deeper. Focusing on getting to a list of next steps instead of focusing on the client. Not questioning assumptions or asking how the client will carry out their next steps. It could mean not pressing on the client’s limiting beliefs or assumptions. In short, low challenge coupled with low support isn’t very helpful for the client.

If you are just learning how to coach, this is a great place to start, but not a great place to stay. Focus on growing your competency and get feedback from a qualified mentor coach.  High Challenge / Low Support This dynamic is extremely common in corporate environments. A boss or a manager is telling an employee to perform a task (high challenge) but being unwilling to provide additional resources to aid in their request. For example, a manager may ask a team of developers to accelerate a project timeline, work longer hours, etc. But when the developers ask for assistance in offloading other work or being excused from time consuming meetings, those requests are not approved. This same dynamic can be in the Agile coaching relationship — especially when the coach is operating more from a consulting mindset than a coaching mindset. In this scenario, the coach might be assessing the actions of the individuals, teams, and organizations and giving opinions on whether those actions are appropriate or inappropriate.  For example, they might be saying things like, “Managers don’t belong at a daily Scrum.” If the coach does not offer the appropriate support of asking the manager what he/she is getting from the daily Scrum the coach creates resistance. The manager will not have their needs met and will push back against the coach who is offering a high level of challenge with low support. Telling a manager, “You need to back up and let the team decide what to do,” offers a high level of challenge and requires the balanced support of asking the manager what problem they are trying to solve and what concerns them. Without the balancing support, the coach destroys the trust needed to create the right level of empowerment and responsibility in the organization. The coach is dominating the organization and is not partnering with them to bring the change the organization desires. Instead, they are enforcing their own agenda. Another example of high challenge/ low support is with a client Cherie had. In her initial conversations with the client, he told her that he needed a strong level of challenge to get him moving. He told her not to hold back and to push him hard. He said he had been procrastinating for two years and wasn't moving forward to meeting his dream of getting his company to the next level. In one of their coaching sessions, the client appeared to be procrastinating and making excuses for why he wasn’t moving forward. He said that he only needed one more client to be self-supporting. He said that all he needed to do to land that one client was to send a few emails to people who were waiting for help. Towards the end of the conversation, Cherie pulled back and looked at the bigger picture, she made a very strong observation. “So, what you’re telling me is that there’s one copy-paste email that you need to send out to ten people. It will take less than 15 minutes. That’s all that’s standing between you and the life you want to live and yet, you won’t send the email. What’s the real reason you won’t take the next step?” Because of the client’s request to be extremely challenging, Cherie confronted him in a more forceful vocal pattern than she uses with other clients. The mistake Cherie made in this situation wasn’t the way she challenged the client. It was that she focused on his request for a high level of challenge and didn’t leverage enough support on that call to bring balance. The client waited 3 months before scheduling another call because he said he wanted to make progress before

they met again. While the story ended well and the client went on to make strong progress, Cherie still learned a lesson. It’s the coach’s responsibility to hold the balance.  Low Challenge / High Support  On the other side of the spectrum is the dynamic where the coach is offering sympathy for the client’s plight but does not exercise the courage to challenge them to take the next step. We call this “colluding.” It’s what friends do when one friend is venting, and the other says, “You’re right. Your boss is a moron,” but won’t challenge the individual to take any responsibility for their own behavior that contributed to the situation. As a result, one party receives a significant amount of support for their situation, but because nothing is challenging them to move forward, the cycle repeats itself endlessly. This same cycle happens in coaching when the coach steps out of the neutral position and takes sides with one team member over another. A team member complains about another team member who they conflict with, and the coach agrees that the other team member should have behaved differently. By doing this, the coach reinforces the behavior of the team member to pull the coach in rather than have a direct conversation with the other person. This creates a higher level of conflict on the team because the team member feels validated. While the coach is being highly supportive, they are not challenging the client to step up and have a healthy conflict to resolve the issue. The client is better served if the coach offers support by saying, “I’m sorry that you are having this conflict. It must be frustrating for you.” Then, offer a balanced challenge to the client by saying, “What can you change to get closer to what you want?” Another example of high support and low challenge that Cherie witnessed was at a company where there had been several acquisitions and people were holding alliances to their original companies. Team members were pulled from their original company’s product and put on a new product team for the acquisition company. The team reacted negatively to the change and were miserable with a new platform, a new manager, a new product, and a whole new work environment they didn’t want. Their performance was suffering. They had delivered very little over the past few months and really seemed to be in victim mode. Cherie sat in on a retrospective where the team focused on problems, they had no control over and talked a lot about how everything external to the team was holding them back. When it came time for them to decide on an improvement plan, the team selected one item: Keep being awesome. The Scrum Master congratulated them for all their hard work and told them how awesome they were and ended the session. This was a situation where the Scrum master was a very nice guy. He had been working with the team members for a few years and was also in a position where he was unhappy with the acquisition. Instead of challenging the team to look at things they had power to change or challenging them to take responsibility for their own actions and decisions, he was colluding with them to remain in victim mode. His high level of support and low level of challenge enabled the team to keep spiraling instead of picking up the pieces and moving forward. The team is better

served if the Scrum Master challenges them to describe what they are doing that makes them so awesome. He could challenge them by asking what value the customers and stakeholders are receiving from the current level of awesomeness.  He could even challenge them by “calling BS” on their “keep being awesome” plan and asking how that is helping them. High Challenge / High Support This quadrant is where the most effective coaching happens. It has support to make the client feel safe, listened to, seen, and encouraged. And it has an equal amount of challenge to push the client to boundaries, disrupt their thinking, and open new perspectives that will keep them moving forward. This balance of challenge and support will show up in different ways depending on the coach and the client. Cherie worked for a team once that wasn’t delivering. When she was assigned to the team, twelve weeks had gone by, and they had only delivered a few stories and no complete features. Cherie observed for an entire sprint before deciding what to do. She noticed that work was backing up at the point where it went into testing. The person doing QA reported each stand-up that he had 1-2 hours left on a certain task, and the task stayed in that state for the entire sprint even though he said he was working on it every day and almost done. There was one newer developer on the team who was very focused on making improvements and getting the team moving forward. He asked if the QA person needed help and was told that he didn’t because he was almost done. During the second sprint Cherie asked if she could do a visual radar with data that might help the team start to see patterns and make more educated decisions about how much work to bring into the sprint. She also wanted the team and product owner to have information that told them if they should inform stakeholders that the work, they promised in the sprint was not going to be delivered. The team agreed to the radar. Cherie made a radar on a flip chart that showed the two weeks of the sprint and for each day there was a red/yellow/green line with a scale of 1-10. Every day at stand-up Cherie asked how confident the team was that they would finish all the work they took into the sprint. Each day they said they were confident. Cherie was able to see from the progress that the work wasn’t likely to get completed and couldn’t understand what was making the team keep declaring confidence. Each day around 3pm Cherie would do a pulse check with the team and ask them to go to the radar and put a dot by the number that represented their level of confidence that all the work committed to in the sprint would be completed.  Around the 5th day, shortly before 3pm the newer developer walked over to the QA person’s desk and said, “Look, in a few minutes she (pointing to Cherie) is going to ask us how confident we are that the work of the sprint is going to be complete. I’m going to lie and say I’m fully confident, and I have no idea where you are or what you are doing, but I’m sick of lying.” The two team members argued while Cherie stayed in her seat trying to hide her joy that they were arguing. After a few minutes they identified what was happening that was causing the QA person to fall behind and worked out a solution to resolve it and got a commitment for how the

work would be reflected on the task board, so everyone could see the progress. They also made an agreement that if anyone on the team was stuck on a task for more than an hour, they would ask for a second pair of eyes on the work. In this scenario Cherie supported the team by taking time to understand their problem, withholding judgment, and giving the team the power to make decisions. She focused on the problem they wanted to solve and utilized tools and techniques to give them the information they needed to become more aware of what was really happening. She challenged the team by not interfering with the long overdue argument. She also challenged them by uncovering the problem and making it highly visible. She applied pressure by asking the daily question, "How confident are you?" consistently and making it more and more uncomfortable to keep up the facade that all was fine. And she challenged them by not solving the problem for them. Ultimately, the core problem on the team was that they were not collaborating and not being transparent when it came to how much work they could handle. It went way beyond the obvious symptom of the QA person not finishing work. The team was outwardly friendly, inwardly boiling, and refusing to go through the storming period that would enable them to combine ideas and become higher performing. By creating an environment where the team felt safe to have conflict, then applying challenging pressure, Cherie was able to help the team break the barriers and move forward. Eventually they became one of the most respected teams in the organization.

Chapter 7: Business Development is for Everyone  We suspect that many people who are reading this book to grow their skills as an enterprise Agile coach fall into a few categories: Internal FTE coaches, Sub-Contract Internal Coaches, and Independent Direct Contract Internal Coaches. Regardless of how you come to work with an organization, one thing remains constant. What you do before jumping in matters!  Discussions with Agile coaches through our years of mentoring others tells us that Agile coaches have a few common recurring challenges when it comes to engaging with new clients. First, taking contract or FTE engagements that sound like a great opportunity only to get in and find out that the client and the coach are very far out of alignment on what needs to be done. Second, taking sub-contracting roles with a staffing agency and finding out after getting on site that the coach’s hands are tied because what the agency sold the client is far from what the Agile coach believes should happen. And the coach doesn’t have access to the decision makers or the power to influence change at the levels where the impediments reside. Third, figuring out how to find new clients as an independent Agile coach.  We also suspect that many who are reading this book will aspire developing their career through a higher-level certification in Agile coaching such as the Scrum Alliance, Certified Enterprise, or Certified Team Coach designations. Many of the baseline aspects of what Scrum Alliance is looking for in candidates of these guide level certifications is what coaches need to really develop their coaching competency and business. As you’ll see in this chapter, getting exposure to potential clients takes a lot of up-front work and our goal is to share some of our experiences and techniques to help you.   Exposure isn’t the only important aspect of business. It is also important to find the right clients and to make sure that you are clear on what you’re getting into. That’s where having a pre-engagement approach comes into the picture. Whether you’re new to the Agile coaching scene and working as a full-time employee or looking to grow your existing practice, a pre-engagement approach can help ensure all new engagements are as successful and satisfying as possible. This chapter fills you in on some ways to find and take on new Agile coaching engagements, complete with a rundown on:  ● Business development activities ● Determining a correct fit  ● Finding out what the client really wants and needs ● Getting clear on the terms of the engagement  Business Development  Perhaps you’ve decided that you are going to go independent, and you’ve created a great website to sell your services and training products to potential customers. It’s possible that you’ve realized that while setting up a website is a great idea, it doesn’t create an unending

stream of clients. A website is simply a landing place where your business development activities drive potential customers to get a better understanding of who you are and what you have to offer.   Michael says, “Your website is not just a business card on the internet. You need to pay attention to it and refresh it on a regular basis. You need to update it with your speaking engagements, new services and other new content that shows you’re an active participant in the industry.”  The challenge is driving traffic to your website and to you as a provider of coaching services. That’s only going to happen if you engage in the art of business development. Business development involves all the activities, ideas and initiatives required for creating or improving a business. These activities take time, effort, and money. There are experts who can help you with a business development plan for your company and they know more about driving sales than we do. And there are lots of things you can begin doing today to get you started.  You have a generous selection of ideas and helpful activities to choose from when it comes to establishing or growing your Agile coaching practice. Regardless of which activities you choose, the key is consistency. For clients to engage you, they have to know who you are. Becoming consistently visible is incredibly important for getting business. Here are a few areas that successful Agile coaches, trainers, and consultants engage to create strong networks and visibility in the Agile community.  Agile Community Involvement, Participation, and Thought Leadership  Some Agile coaches get a lot of business from other Agile coaches, particularly when existing clients of those coaches need a specialty that another coach can provide. Michael says, “Let’s say a coach comes to me and tells me they specialize in Upstream Kanban. I will keep them in mind and pass along their name to clients who ask, as I’m not an expert in that area.” Getting involved in the Agile community enables you to learn from the Agile community and to connect to others.   Beyond learning, conferences are great opportunities to meet new people and engage with community leaders in meaningful ways. Events in the Agile community range from free local or virtual events to in person major conferences around the world. There’s always something available in your time zone and budget if you know what to look for. Some examples of events that are great for learning and building strong networks of people with a wide range of interests and experiences are below.   ● Major conferences held by organizations like Scrum Alliance, Agile Alliance, ICF, EMCC. These major conferences often involve domestic and international travel and can be costly. They are also the major events where agilists and coaches around the world come to network and share ideas.  

---

49 
● Local conferences are often sponsored by Agile and coaching communities or Agile focused companies and are generally an affordable option without the expense of travel. These events generally have a reasonably low-ticket price. ● User groups and meetups are often a great entry point for engaging with the Agile community. Many of these events are virtual so you can join communities around the world, build networks, and learn new creative ways of solving problems. These events are usually free. ● Coaching camps are often sponsored by local Agile communities and by larger organizations. These are often a mix of open space and targeted learning with lots of time for practices and networking. These are generally low-cost events and might include travel costs. ● Open space and lean coffee events are often held as part of major conferences or sponsored by local user groups to collaborate and share thoughts and ideas about current issues in the Agile world. ● Public training classes are a great way to have access to experienced thought leaders who can answer questions and give guidance while teaching on a topic that you need to grow your career.  Training is moderately costly and often results in a certification or formal continuous education credits.  Agile community participation can open the door for great relationships with other agilists around the world. What it doesn’t necessarily do is get you exposure to people who want to buy your products and services. To get exposure, you need to also focus on making contributions that will impact the growth of the Agile community through sharing your expertise and experience. Thought leadership and helping others in the Agile community grow into stronger careers and become more successful with clients is a great way to gain exposure to prospective clients without doing lots of “selling.”  An added benefit is that most conferences extend registration to the event as speaker compensation. Some of the major conferences will also pay hotel or travel expenses. In general, unless you are a Keynote speaker conferences do not compensate in cash, although there are exceptions.   A great way to get started speaking in the Agile community is through meetups and user groups. Agile communities around the world meet monthly to provide a learning space for members. This is a great way to get comfortable presenting topics you are passionate about. Most speakers develop the content for two or three presentations a year and present them at multiple conferences and user groups. Different people attend the events so the topics can be reused, improved, and modified for each group as necessary to keep them relevant. A simple search on meetup or search engine for Agile meetups or Agile user groups can yield lots of options. Searching the term “Agile call for papers” or something similar can present options around the world for submitting your talks to both major and minor conferences. Don’t let your worries about not being known keep you from submitting. The only way to get known is to get out there and do it. Conference reviewers generally focus on the topic and abstract, not the person presenting the topic to select the conference lineup, so everyone has a fair shot.

## Page 50

Michael’s perspective is that more experienced speakers may have half a dozen talks that can be given on a moment’s notice. Newer coaches may have one or two. Every so often, coaches refresh their talks to present new ones. When reaching out to organizations who are potential clients, say, “Here’s a set of five talks I have. I think this one will resonate with your organization.”  While it might seem like a great opportunity to make some cash to present a topic at a company, think longer term. It is more effective if you give these small talks for free. It creates more opportunities to get your name out there and establish authority in front of lots of people. Once you’ve already made a connection with the company and they see the quality of your work there’s a stronger chance they’ll call you for a paid coaching or training event. Speaking is a primary business development tool. We challenge you to find a way to speak to a group at least once a month, sometimes several times a week if you’re doing a big launch.”  Once you get selected as a speaker at an event, don’t forget to leverage the power of social media to get your face and name associated with having something to say in the Agile community. Many people don’t post announcements of events they are speaking at because they feel awkward self-promoting. One way to think about it is that you are building a brand in the industry and the only way you can build that brand is to get it visible. Let others know what you are speaking about - it may create an opportunity for them to ask you to come present at their company community of practice or to do a lunch and learn event that can be the open door for you to get new clients.  Writing is another highly effective business development tool, especially in the form of content marketing. Content marketing involves consistently sharing valuable, compelling content that delivers information readers want to know while positioning you as an expert in your field.  It also helps potential clients understand how you coach.   Another way to make contributions to the Agile community is to get involved in writing and publishing content that is useful and easily accessible. Content can include things like blogs, videos, white papers, or even getting involved with community-based volunteer projects that get learning materials into the hands of others.   Keep in mind that simply writing a blog and publishing it might feel like a huge amount of work and be an exciting accomplishment, but it won’t bring you visibility if no one reads it. Promoting your content via social media either through posts or digital marking is an important step to getting your work visible. Getting your work visible is even more important than creating it. The more you engage the world with your content, the more helpful you will be and the more visibility you will have. When people see your name and associate it with a particular topic. When they get stuck on that topic, they will remember you and it increases the chances of getting a call for help.  Michael says, “I personally focus on posting something on LinkedIn at least once a day, and something on Medium several times a week. I also co-author at least one book every year.

Contributing to trusted publications, like InfoQ and Forbes, is another good way to get your name and content out there.” The key is consistent engagement with the community you want to impact.  Cherie shares, “One example of community contributions I’ve made that has had a big impact on the growth of the Agile community is the Scrum Alliance Labs Path to Coaching Program. This program contains over 80 videos and lays the foundation for understanding the competencies needed to coach Agile organizations via an invitational coaching approach. This series has over 45,000 users as of mid 2021 with new registrations happening daily. This project has injected lots of learning into the Agile space, has created curiosity for professional coaching, and has created a connection between me and the Agile community that is amazing. It is not uncommon for me to speak to people for the first time and hear them say that they feel like they know me because they have spent so much time with me in the videos I created. This project took me roughly 40 hours to complete and we published unedited rough videos. It didn’t have to be perfect - it just had to be valuable.”   Another example of contributing to and leadership in the Agile community is the Best Agile Articles project. Originally Michael’s idea, this project curates the Best Agile Articles published by agilists around the world and packages them into a single book each year. The idea behind this project is that there is plenty of wisdom in the Agile community and it is often hard to find. So, having a single place where great ideas can reside and be distributed is a considerably valuable concept. The first BAA book was published in 2017 through the work of a group of volunteers from the Agile community. The PDF version is given away free as a community resource and hard copies and Kindle versions can be purchased via Amazon. The articles that make it to the book are selected via double blind voting where volunteers read the nominated articles and vote on the articles with no knowledge of who the author of the articles is. Many new authors are represented in the publication and get exposure that they would not otherwise have. The BAA project also hosts the BAA website where access to all year's articles can be found. The point of the book isn’t for us to make money, it’s to make an impact and to increase the visibility of people in the community who are using writing to contribute value to the Agile world.  Community Leadership  Another way to invest in the Agile community while creating visibility for your talent is to take an active role in community leadership activities. This might include volunteering for existing events and organizations to create avenues for people to learn and to share their experience with others. Connect with local Agile communities and volunteer to assist with conferences, meetups, and other events. If there’s no local community, start one. Certification organizations that are unique to Agile, such as the Women in Agile, Scrum Alliance, Scrum.org, and Agile Alliance are all visible organizations with credibility who are making an impact on the Agile world. Working with them in a volunteer capacity helps you establish authority and increase visibility. Volunteering to run an event or serve on a volunteer committee can be a great way to build a professional network with agilists from across the globe.

 Another great way to promote your company is to start an annual event. Michael hosts a local conference, Agile Games West in San Francisco, with about 100 people in attendance every year.   Creating Sustainable Change and Scaling Agile Coaching with Business Development  Maybe you are in an FTE role and thinking that this business development chapter doesn’t really apply to me. Well, it does. While a lot of the business development activities are designed to help independent Agile coaches, Agile coaches who work full-time in organizations also need to keep business development at the forefront of their minds. Rob Rubin says, “You need to build your personal brand as well as your company’s brand.”  Unlike more established job roles and fields, Agile coaching is relatively new. It doesn’t have a career ladder to follow, or any set path to greater and greater success. That means Agile coaches really must advocate for themselves, even within an organization. One way to do that is to become an industry leader and gain competency and experienced certifications such as the Scrum Alliance, Certified Team or Enterprise Coach. These designations require community involvement, contribution, and leadership as part of the path. So, even if you don’t intend to be an independent coach these activities serve a purpose to help you develop in your career.  At some point, you are likely to be looking for a full-time coaching job. One of the easiest ways for employers to get to know you is to look at your online content.  Getting to know you through your resume is typically not ideal. Resumes tend to deliver a rather dull list of been-there’s, done-that’s. High-quality online content does a much better job of showcasing your knowledge, skills, attitudes, and overall personality.   Another way you can use business development is to leverage it to create sustainable change within your current organization by utilizing the same activities and content to build a content library. This gives you visibility in the company both now and when you are gone. It keeps you front of mind so when they are looking for help in the future, they are likely to reach out to you. They also have you in mind when someone asks for a referral for a position.   Cherie discovered the formula for getting the most value out of intellectual capital while working with clients doing enterprise Agile adoption work. She was in a full-time employee role as the only enterprise coach in a huge company. She quickly found that she needed ways to scale her coaching impact without overextending herself because there were simply too many people wanting to learn from her. She had previously worked in large enterprises and knew the value of scaling her work to make a greater impact and to work at a sustainable pace, so she began looking for a similar opportunity with this employer. She was getting pulled on to answer some questions over and over, so she began utilizing the company’s intranet system to build an Agile information center. As she answered questions for people, she began to build a backlog of common questions and challenges happening in the organization. Rather than answering the same questions over and over, Cherie began writing blogs and creating short videos to answer

these questions. This allowed her to answer the questions thoughtfully and more fully. It also created a content library where she could send people to get them in the habit of looking there for information rather than asking Cherie. When someone asked a question by email that she already had content on, she would send them the link and tell them that they could find the answer to this question and many others in the content library. This trained people to go there first and created a way to develop sustainability for the organization so that long after she left, they still had this content to utilize.   A great side benefit of creating the content on the company’s intranet was that when Cherie visited new offices people recognized her from her videos and immediately had trust and rapport. She also had credibility because people had already utilized her content to learn and solve problems on their own.   Cherie further used this method to develop other Agile coaches in the organization. She worked with Scrum Masters, Product Owners, and managers to create content describing problems they solved, techniques and experiences they tried, and to share things they were learning with one another. By doing this she was not only helping individuals grow but was creating a self-developing organization that curated its own expertise to continue learning in a sustainable way long after she was gone. Sustainable change is a powerful way to leave a mark on an organization.   In later years, after she left that organization to start her own company, Cherie found out that people were still using the content she created to learn and grow. Her impact remained and she continued to get exposure and gain credibility in the company. This enabled her to return occasionally to do consultations and coaching as an external consultant and coach. Because people knew her through her work, they trusted her to return to help them.  Another valuable thing Cherie did was reuse the content she shared with the company for business development externally. She made sure that her writings and videos were free from any references to the company and utilized them to post on her website to share with the Agile community. Each time she created a piece of content to share internally she shared it externally also. In the same way, she reused content she created for the external world to share internally. Whenever she developed a conference presentation, she also used it to do sessions internally. When she created content for her website to share in the Agile community, she reused it to post on the company intranet. So, in essence, she was using her content to make an impact on her clients, the Agile community, and the future of the company she would one day open.   Cherie’s advice about business development is to “waste nothing and reuse everything.” None of these business development activities are fast fixes and they are often investments into your personal brand or a company you haven’t even decided to open yet. These approaches typically require a long period of time to develop momentum. You must engage in the activities repeatedly without a lot of feedback. It typically takes years to start getting inbound queries so it's never too early to get started to build your personal brand and simply make an impact on the

Agile community. Even if you never decide to go out on your own, you will be making a valuable contribution to the world.  Michael says, “In my case, it took about 10 years to get established as an independent Agile coach and only work with clients who reach out to me. You just need to find one thing and do it repeatedly. I found that writing best suited my skills and interests, so I write mini posts every day, longer articles every week, and a book every year. This is not to discourage you. It’s just to let you know what to expect—and to underscore the importance of persistence. Keep your writing, speaking, and digital marketing going daily. People will begin to look forward to it. Stop your daily outreach, and people will quickly forget about you. One of my favorite sayings is, ‘Get going and then get good.’ It's a reminder not to fall into the trap of perfectionism. One of the biggest enemies of Agile coaches is perfectionism. They think they must be perfect—to hit on that perfect pearl of wisdom with everything they do or create. This type of mindset blocks them from doing anything at all, never mind doing things repeatedly.”  To Niche of not to Niche - That is the Question  The question of niche is an interesting one. In most business development advice, you’ll hear that you must pick a niche to focus on. Cherie shares, “I am not certain that picking a niche is how it really works. In my experience at least, I didn’t go out looking for a niche and find one to label myself with. What happened in my case was that I fell in love with a particular type of work, became good at it, and became known for it. So, I guess you could say my niche found me. The reason I bring this up is because people often stress over picking a niche when they are in the beginning of their career development. Before they have had the opportunity to experience working with a variety of clients doing a variety of things, they are trying to pick one thing to be known for. To me that’s like deciding as a young child what you are going to be when you grow up. You can only speak from the perspective of what you think might be interesting but without the experience of doing that you don’t know if it’s what you are going to want to spend your life doing. My point here is that you may have a sense of what you want to focus on, but you don’t have to decide that up front and then miss the opportunity to discover what you really love and what kind of clients you want to work with.”   That said, it can be a powerful business development strategy to position or brand yourself in a very specific niche. Rather than being a generic Agile coach, having a market differentiator can open the right doors you really want to walk into. Being known as a specific type of Agile coach, one with a focused specialization can set you apart from the crowd. When people have a specific need, they seek you out based upon your specialization which can mean that you get more of the work you love to do.  Lyssa Adkins is known for her contributions defining the work of Agile coaching as a mix of consulting, mentoring, training, facilitating, and professional coaching. Cherie Silas is known for her contributions strengthening the competency of professional coaching in the Agile world.

the Agile world. Roman Pichler is known for his work in the product management space. Michael Sahota is known for his culture and leadership work. Michael de la Maza is known for contributing to the Agile games community and helped start Agile Games New England, Agile Games West, and Agile Games Midwest conferences.  Having a specialized niche can make you more valuable, as does being good at what you do. There is a certain stratum of clients who want the best in the business, and they will pay for it. That’s the goal of your branding - connecting you to those people. In a growing field, performance is extremely valuable. Being excellent at what you do makes business development becomes a lot easier. You share your passion and deliver what you promise, and people start to talk. In today's technology and social media driven world, word-of-mouth marketing is a powerful business driver, with the ability to generate ongoing business from satisfied clients.  Michael says, “In 2010 I worked with Rob Rubin when he was VP of Engineering at Carbonite, a successful startup that went public. He hired me again, five years later, when he was working at edX, an educational non-profit in Massachusetts.” Determining a Good Fit    While your ultimate goal as an Agile coach may be to have a steady stream of dream companies knocking at your door, either working with you as a consultant or hiring you as an employee, you may have to adjust your expectations a bit at the start. You may want to open the door for varying opportunities that may not be ideal until you become more established. Working in these companies can be a great learning experience. As you get experience and build competency to make an impact with clients you will want to start thinking about making sure you select the right clients to work with.   
Chapter 8 - Selecting the Right Clients Many Agile coaches are most inclined—and overjoyed—to enter an engagement in which an Agile mindset already exists. But it’s too much to ask a client to be Agile before the Agile transformation begins. Which brings us to a big question. What kind of coach do you really want to be? A second question is also important to ask yourself is, “At what point do I want to enter an engagement?” These two questions need to be answered before you start finding your next client if you want to take on work that you truly enjoy doing.  The first question, “What kind of coach do I really want to be,” is about understanding if the work you enjoy doing is Organizational Coaching, Agile Adoption and Process Improvement Coaching, Culture Transition Coaching, Product Management Development Coaching, or Business Agility Coaching, etc. You may be thinking that you want to do it all! Perhaps you label yourself an Agile Transformation Coach. Whatever you decide, it’s important to understand what

that means because it defines the scope of the work you enjoy and the intention of the clients you want to work with.   If you view yourself as an Agile Transformation coach and you go into an organization where the person who brought you in wants to push Agile on the company. Then, when you get there, you realize that what the leaders of the company want is to improve their existing waterfall practices. They are okay with a few isolated Scrum teams and maybe Kanban teams but have no intention to do a wide sweeping transformation work. You are going to be miserable trying to force your client to do something they aren’t interested in doing. However, if you view yourself as an organizational coach who is there to help the organization improve. It won’t matter if Agile is the answer or if simply mapping out their existing processes and helping them find ways to make them work better is what they need.   It may take you a while to figure out what kind of work you really enjoy doing so experiment and take note of what work motivates you and what doesn’t. Over time you can isolate what you love and focus on that. The second question is also important to find the answer to if you want to do work you really enjoy. “At what point do I want to enter an engagement?”  Maybe you want to work in companies that already have an Agile mindset, they are relatively successful with their implementation of Agile, and need someone to help them maintain and improve that momentum. That’s fine and those are wonderfully satisfying companies to work in. You get to enjoy the benefits of working in the environment you truly love. The goal of many Agile coaches is to work in an Agile company. Here’s the catch. If that’s the environment you want to work in, you need to refer to question one and make sure you’ve answered it according to this.   Agile Transformation Coaches and Organizational Coaches rarely get to work in these environments. They enter environments where the company has done no work at all towards becoming more Agile or they’ve done a few home-grown isolated efforts that haven’t gained much traction. They face tons of resistance and a big uphill climb to get to an Agile environment. It takes years and often the coach is gone before it’s fully realized if it is realized at all.  There’s also the question of whether you want to be an Agile coach in a multi-team environment or an enterprise coach working with entire large enterprises and whole company structures. Either way, unless it’s a very small company, chances are you can’t do it alone. Scrum Alliance defines a Certified Team Coach (CTC) as a coach who works with organizations that have multiple teams. They work directly with teams and the first and second layer of management. The name “Certified Team Coach” may give the wrong message about the work. A CTC is a coach of an organization and often focuses mostly on engineering and product management areas. If it has more than 10 teams or so, there is probably more than one coach who will be working there.   Scrum Alliance defines a Certified Enterprise Coach (CEC) as a coach who works with the top layers of management in an enterprise down to the first and second layers of management.

They may work with teams also in smaller organizations but in larger enterprises they generally work with leadership. They also focus far beyond engineering and product management. Their work stretches out into all areas of the company such as Human Resources where they might help them to define new job roles and role definitions or develop new merit and compensation practices that focus on team-based work rather than individual contributor work. They might help them develop new performance management structures that support team environments. A CEC might work with the finance and PMO departments to help them develop new ways to map cost to capitalization and change funding models to team or project based rather than project or FTE count.   They might work with Audit to help them understand how to map the current waterfall-based audit questions to where those controls can be found in an Agile environment. They might work with sales, marketing, and operations to help them find better ways to communicate to the customers in collaboration with product management so what they sell matches what’s being built and can communicate delivery dates in a more skillful manner. They may work with legal to develop Agile contracts to replace waterfall focused contracts. They are also working with leaders on strategy and looking at business objectives that aren’t being met to understand what changes can be made in the organization that will achieve the desired business results.   These are just a few examples of things an Enterprise Coach might be doing, and depending on where they wish to specialize, the focus will likely narrow a bit. Doing all this work in a small company with less than 10 teams is very different from doing it in a company with thousands of employees with multiple divisions and engineering groups. In these very large companies, it is likely that there will be multiple Enterprise Coaches each working with separate divisions. Coordination and collaboration become important in these situations so each coach can leverage the collective wisdom and momentum of the others to bring the entire company forward in a more cohesive way.   Understanding the kind of work, you want to do and where you want to enter the process is important to help you narrow down and find the right clients. As you can see from the examples given previously there are lots of facets to this work. It can rarely be done alone since such an extensive skill set and background are needed to understand how to help the client get the results they desire. No one can know everything so understanding what you do know and what you want to focus on will help you to thrive.   Michael shares, “When I started off as an independent Agile coach, any client who was willing to pay me was a good fit. I needed the money. Once things got rolling, I created a detailed checklist that helped me decide if an engagement was one, I wanted to take. That checklist included things like the size and level of the organization, driving distance and compensation.   Today I have a lot of inbound requests for my services, and I can afford to be even more selective. I use my intuition and examine my feelings when I’m speaking with prospective clients to determine if they seem like a match.

Charting a Correct Fit   Determining a correct fit can also be done using a three-by-three chart, one that cross-references the team, group and organization with practices, structure, and culture. New coaches typically start off at the team level focusing on practices.  To use the chart, simply indicate with a check mark what are your areas of focus. If you focus on team-level practices, then you would put a checkmark in the upper left-hand box. If you focus on organizational culture, you will put a checkmark in the lower right-hand box. Most coaches focus on several of the nine areas. Very few focus on all nine. This will help you attract suitable clients and repel the ones who are not a good fit.   Team Organization Enterprise Practices    Structure    Culture     Financials also have to be reasonable, although what defines reasonable will vary for everyone. Just like any other profession, when first getting started rates are on the lower end and once you get established, they will likely go up.   Michael notices, “Many Agile coaches grossly underprice their services. You need to get to a point that you’re comfortable asking for what you’re worth. Compensation is a signal of quality. When you price your services like a junior project coordinator, the client will expect to utilize you as one.”  Pre- Engagement Conversations  Conversations with prospective clients need to be highly transparent, with both parties having a clear idea of how the engagement is designed to unfold. Pre-engagement discussions are your opportunity to make sure that you and the client are fully aligned and that you both understand the what and the why of the engagement. Even if you are working towards getting a full-time employee role in an organization as a coach, it is important to do the proper pre-engagement work before accepting an offer. This can mean the difference between doing the work you love and feeling trapped in an impossible situation that you hate.   If you are an independent coach, pre-engagement conversations are likely called negotiations, proposal reviews, or pitches. However, if you are searching for FTE contracting or subcontracting positions these are more likely called interviews. Looking at pre-engagement conversations as a series of job interviews can put you in a mindset that won’t be particularly helpful to set up a strong start point as an enterprise coach.

If your goal is to be an Agile coach focused on helping already Agile teams and organizations improve, you will probably treat these conversations more as interviews. You’ll be looking for answers to questions like: ● What is the culture of the organization? ● How connected is leadership to ensuring that agility is valued and promoted? ● How are teams organized and what roles exist in the organization? ● What is the role of the Scrum master? ● How are Product Owners utilized in the organization? ● What do you expect the role of the Agile coach to be responsible for? ● How many hours per week are most people working? ● How available will the managers be to me? ● What are your biggest organizational and technical impediments and challenges?   These questions are all about the current state of the organization and the environment the coach will work in. These are great questions if your interest is to join an organization that is already well on its way in its adoption of Agile. These engagements can be fun, interesting, and somewhat challenging. It’s a great place for someone who is just getting into Agile coaching to start and can be a very comfortable place to work for years.   For people who are looking into enterprise coaching and are possibly coming in at the very beginning of an engagement or into a failed engagement the questions you want to ask are very different. These conversations are more about setting expectations and uncovering what’s really happening in the organization. These are the conversations where you bring alignment and ensure that the client understands what they are getting ready to undertake. This is also your opportunity to make sure that what you want to do is in alignment with what the client wants and will tolerate.  As you’re shaping proposals for prospective clients, it’s best to collaborate and co-create the proposal together. Make the proposal a living document that you both are editing and contributing to. Schedule multiple conversations about the proposal as it is being developed.   One of the practices that can take up lots of your personal time and not return results is to have a 10-minute conversation about what the client wants then creating a proposal on your own and sending it over for review. You’re likely to hear, “OK, we’ll evaluate it and get back to you.” And that may be the last thing you hear. Ever.   Their evaluation may take extensive time.  They may change their minds a dozen times.  They may hire someone else while you’re still waiting for a response. They may never get back to you at all.  They may not have the budget for what’s in the proposal. They may be price shopping and trying to find the best deal.

Remember, Agile coaching is a partnership. This partnership begins in the early stages. A more effective move is to tell the organization you’ll create a draft of a proposal that you can make edits on together. This allows them to make the exact changes they want directly on the proposal while you’re both in on the conversation. It creates partnership and shows the client that the work you do with them will be collaborative. They’ll know from the very start that you aren’t going to go off and do the work and make decisions while they focus on more important things. If the work they want you to do isn’t important enough to warrant their time and energy defining it, this may be an indicator of what you’ll experience once you get in and start working.  Be Direct: ‘Unsell’ Yourself  Rather than trying to persuade clients to hire you, ask pointed questions that get to the heart of why they are turning to Agile at this point in their journey. An important question to ask them is: What happens if you don’t do this change initiative?  This question builds a business case for what they need. It also creates a sense of urgency when you ask if the work needs to happen today. You want to hear them say yes, it needs to happen now. This directly relates back to the value of what needs to be done, the value of what it’s worth.   Another important question is: Why did you call me specifically?   You want to find out why they picked you and not one of the thousands of other Agile coaches in the market. The response you get can be reflected to them in the proposal. If they say they picked you for your specific experience with XYZ, your proposal should mention how you have specific experience with XYZ.  Another question you don’t want to fail to ask is: Why do you need to do this now?   This question further highlights the urgency (or lack thereof) while also increasing a prospective client’s trust in you. Maybe they’re not sure why the work needs to be done now, or perhaps they say that it doesn’t. If that’s the case, you can say something like, “Then let’s not do it right now. Circle back to me in three months.”    At this level, the pre-engagement work is more about conversations you want to have with the client, not just questions you want answered to make sure that there is a good fit for you to enjoy working there. Before jumping into an engagement, it is important to understand the “whys” behind the client’s desire to bring in an Agile coach so you can understand what they really need. We recommend that at a minimum you have discussions with the client about these topics before proposing what you might offer.   Business challenges and expected results: It’s important to understand what problems the client is having that they are hoping Agile will help them resolve. It is not uncommon for a client to give the answer to this question as they want to adopt Agile. The problem they are attempting to 

---

## Page 61

 
61 
solve is that they don’t know how. As previously mentioned, Agile is not the goal. Agile is a set of solutions implemented to solve business problems. It is important to get clear on the business problems the client has that they are hoping Agile will help them resolve. If the person you are speaking to can’t tell you the business problems either they are not the right person to be speaking to or they are not ready to undertake the work of adopting Agile.   Definition of success: It’s important to understand how the client will measure success of the engagement. This should tie back to business results and there will also be some other things included in the definition of success. It’s important for you and them to get clear on what will tell them that the business results have been achieved. You’ll have time once in the engagement to get into specific detailed measures of success for each objective they have so in these conversations you are looking to understand what success looks like at the business level.  This conversation will also give you the information you need to determine what kind of engagement the client wants. [See the chapter on Engagement Types for a deeper description of the engagement types.]   The investment level: This is a defining topic that will make it clear what type of engagement the client is looking for, how much change they really want, and what they are willing to invest to get to the end they desire. Therefore, it is important to understand the business results they are trying to achieve. Understanding the challenges, they have, and business results they want will give insight into some of what might need to happen to get to those results. For example, suppose their business challenge is that they want to improve time to market because they are losing customers who complain that they aren’t getting the features they want. It is important to help them understand that this might mean that there will need to be technology changes which will come at a high cost. Depending on their current state, adding automation to speed up delivery time might mean the client will have to invest in training their current workforce or hiring people who know how to do the automation work. It might mean that they need to make major investments and changes in how code is managed and restricted to move faster. This may mean that you will want to talk to technology leaders prior to taking the engagement to make sure there is alignment. It also may mean that the way they are doing product development today will need to change. This means that there will be impacts to product management or a need to shift from projects to products which will impact funding structure, job roles, and will cost money to train and hire people to focus on this work.  It is important to help the client understand what they are asking for and how deeply they want to invest in making change happen. The level of investment the client is willing to make will determine the scope of the work. It will also tell you if you are the right coach to lead the effort.  Michael recommends, “Get all of the stakeholders and decision makers in the room during the proposal process. When everyone’s together in a group, you may find the people at the company themselves are not fully aligned. The PMO of a fast-growing startup reached out to me, saying they were aligned with the VP of Engineering and the VP of Product about increasing agility throughout the organization. Once we got everyone in a room, we collectively

discovered that the two VPs had a very different perspective—one that was not aligned with the PMO.”   Budget: The budget conversation encompasses more than just your hourly rate. It includes the total amount of money the company has earmarked for the changes they want to make. You need to consider how many coaches it will take to get the results the client wants. Unless it is a small company or the client wants to only do surface level work, chances are you can’t do it alone. Does the client understand the level of financial cost involved in the work and do they have the budget to dedicate to the changes they need to make? Do they have funding for training, hiring, organizational restructure, technical restructure, or do they just want one individual to come and help them improve what they are already doing with no major changes?   These initial conversations can help you to have a discussion with the client about the scope of the work and what it might take to get there. Until you know this information it’s going to be hard to put together a proposal and discuss the cost of the engagement.   Cherie says, “A core difference I see in doing enterprise adoption and transformation work and being an Agile coach is that someone who wants to just join an organization and be an Agile coach is more interested in culture and discusses the working conditions and tactical aspects of the work with the client. Someone who understands enterprise-wide adoption is going to focus more on the bigger strategic picture and what it’s going to take to turn the whole ship around. There is a different level of focus, talent, and experience needed for enterprise work. I see lots of people labeling themselves as enterprise coaches on LinkedIn, but I’m not fully convinced that they all understand what that means. I would rather lose a client who isn’t ready to take on all the changes needed to get the business results they want than to take an engagement and be miserable because the client wants magic to happen without them making the required investment. I don’t have a magic wand.”  Michael shares, “One prospective client requested a proposal with very specific details. They said they had long-term objectives in mind and wanted one-on-one coaching, executive coaching, and management coaching. I submitted a proposal covering all they asked for. I later found out they switched to wanting someone for team coaching with short-term objectives. It’s important to know the client will very often not have the vaguest understanding of what they really want or will not express it using standard Agile terminology. They will often change their mind during the proposal process without being explicit. It’s up to you to help the client be explicit. Think of them as having a big, messy ball of yarn in their heads. The proposal process helps them unwind it.”    Aligning on what the client wants and what you offer   After this initial set of conversations, if the client still seems viable for you it’s important to align on some high-level strategy before jumping in. Leaving this step out of the process can mean that you end up in a situation where the client expects you to make the changes to their company while they sit by idly watching you work. It can also mean that you end up in a

63 
situation where the client expects you to tell them what to do so they don’t have to make decisions. If you get into one of these situations it also means that the client has someone to blame when things don’t go as planned – you.   Cherie shares her process: “Before accepting an engagement, I have a conversation about who I am, the work I do, how I operate, and what I expect from them as a client. They need to understand that I am a coach. Yes, I also do some consulting, but I will not take ownership for the changes they want to make. That’s their job.   Some of the discussions I have around this are:   What to look for in an Agile coach: The client needs to understand what an Agile coach is and what they do. There are many different types of Agile coaches who have different focuses. Depending on what the client wants they will need different coaches to do the work. I make sure that clients understand the level of talent and experience they should be looking for in an enterprise coach. Even if I’m not the right coach for them, I want them to understand what to look for as they continue their search.   How I work and what I expect: I want to make sure that before hiring me my clients understand what I do and how I expect to work with them. I describe the different ways I might be engaging with them including consulting, mentoring, training, facilitating, and coaching. I also make it extremely clear that they own the changes they wish to make. I am their partner in the endeavor. I don’t have (nor want) the power to make changes in their organization and what I want for them is to develop sustainable change. If I own the change, that won’t happen. I also expect direct access and 1-1 coaching relationships to the leaders whose organizations will be working to adopt change. If that can’t happen, they aren’t ready for enterprise coaching.   I also require that the client provide an individual or preferably a team of people who are at a level that has budget and decision-making power with the influence to implement widespread change. These are the people who I will be partnering with who will be responsible for facilitating the changes in the organization.   Disengagement plan: Before starting an engagement, it is important to be clear on how and under what terms the engagement will end. How long should the client expect the coach to work with them? Cherie says, “For smaller efforts that aren’t looking for widespread enterprise change, I personally cap my time investment at one year. For large enterprises wanting to do major work, we discuss a three-year horizon. I am also very clear with the client that this timeline doesn’t mean the work will be complete – it means this is when I plan to disengage. For longer engagements we discuss the strategy for how I fade out over time.”    Signing the deal

Depending on the size of the company and the scope of work, this initial pre-engagement work might take many months (sometimes years for large enterprises). This is one reason why most of the coaches I see in the industry do more contract or subcontract work after another company has gone through this engagement process. Doing that is a viable way to earn a living. It also may put you in a position where you take on an engagement blindly without this pre-work and just dive in to do what you can. This is yet another reason why you need to be clear on what kind of coach you are and what work you want to do. Dealing with the specifics of winning engagements can be a long arduous process that not everyone wants to undertake. It is certainly easier and faster to sub-contract for someone else who has already done the deeper pre-engagement work.   If you are taking on an FTE role, the final negotiations are likely to focus on total compensation. If you are taking on a sub-contract with an agency the final negotiations are likely about hourly rate or corp-to-corp requirements. However, if you are contracting directly with the client, you will be discussing Master Services Agreements (MSA) and Statements of Work (SOW).  Master Services Agreement is the document that outlines the terms and conditions of being a vendor who can do business with their company. It is not specific to the work you will be doing. Rather, it outlines the corp-to-corp rules and agreements. These agreements may outline things like requirements to carry liability and/or workers compensation insurance. It also covers things like intellectual property ownership, non-disclosure, non-solicitation, arbitration, etc. It is important to read these documents carefully because this is the overarching agreement with the company that will potentially enable you to do work there for years to come. Once you can get an MSA signed with a company it generally makes the process much quicker in the future.   After you get an MSA signed, the actual work outlined in your proposal will be described in the Statement of Work. Each piece of work you do for the company under separate proposals over time will be covered by a SOW. Generally, the person with ownership of the budget has authority to sign off on SOW’s up to a given dollar amount. It’s important to understand what that dollar amount is when you prepare the proposal. If the work, they want to do is larger than that dollar amount the SOW will have to go through extended reviews and approvals and can get stuck in the process for months.   Often, when the work is too large, it can be split into multiple proposals and SOWs to keep them under the maximum signature authority limits. For example, training might be placed into one proposal/SOW and coaching placed in another. Together the total cost of these may be significantly above the limits of the budget holder. However, when separated they both fall within the limits to get signed quickly. The quicker the SOW gets signed, the quicker you can start the engagement.   The SOW will contain the terms described in the proposal. It’s a good idea to make sure that the SOW is Agile in nature and contains terms that allow for iterative discovery and updates to expected outcomes and focus. Michael says, “You’re never sure how things are going to progress as you start the coaching, and you don’t want to paint yourself into a corner you can’t

get out of. Never make any drop-dead promises. You can only do so much. The rest is up to the organization. If the client doesn’t have cross-functional teams, don’t promise you can create cross-functional teams. You can’t change the organization they have. You can only work with them to help them change themselves. Don’t be in the business of selling miracles.”   Summing It Up  Good intentions are not good enough when it comes to helping to ensure a coaching engagement will succeed. To paraphrase Deming, it’s not enough to have good intentions, you need to know what to do and have good intentions. You need a set of pre-engagement actions that make sure all the pieces are in place to map out a successful path.  Business development activities help draw clients your way, at which time you can determine if they’re a good fit. Talking to clients about the engagement is a must, a discussion that can be bolstered by co-creating the proposal and asking pointed questions. Your final step is to create detailed terms for the engagement that include details on payment, delivery, and outcomes.    While there is never a 100% guarantee that every Agile coaching engagement you take will work out perfectly, a pre-engagement system will go a long way to ensure that you engage with the right clients most of the time. And if you keep up your side of the agreement, there’s an excellent chance you’ll keep advancing and finish strong.  
Chapter 9: The Relationship Agreement: STORMMES(c) Model Congratulations! You’ve landed that role as an Agile coach, and you’re ready to help an organization bring about sweeping changes that will impact the way they think about developing products and services. Coaching an organization through this change means that you’ll likely be working with leaders, teams, and individuals.   There’s going to be lots of relationships to manage. How will your clients know what to expect from you? How does the client know what you expect from them? Where does your responsibility stop and theirs begin? What outcomes do they expect to get from your engagement? How will you measure success? There are so many important questions you likely have about how you and the client will know the engagement is successful and that you have added value to their organization. Guess what? The client has those same questions, and it's part of the coaching to work with them to make those answers clear.  If you’ve ever attended a professional coach training program, it's likely that you had lots of practice with creating a coaching agreement for the coaching session. In Cherie and Alex’s coach training program at Tandem Coaching Academy, they have found that this is the number one competency that professional coaches struggle with getting right. Why? Because it’s hard. One reason it's so hard is that while a coaching conversation is supposed to sound like a conversation happening between two people in a strong relationship, it’s a different kind of conversation. In day-to-day conversations, you generally don’t start with questions like, “What is 

---

66 
the purpose of our conversation today?” and “What would you like to accomplish in the time we have together?” and “How will you know that we have had a successful conversation?” That’s just weird.  Add to that the fact that a coaching relationship isn’t intended to be a relationship like you have with your friends or loved ones. It’s a professional relationship that maintains a level of vulnerability and trust that often exceeds the borders of relationships with friends and families. However, these relationships are not intended to extend beyond the borders of professionalism. Coaching relationships are confidential in nature and the coach and client come together for a specific purpose to achieve specific goals.   Cherie shares, “I’ve seen many coaches jump into coaching relationships in the same way they handled practice sessions with other coaching students. Every conversation is a one-off conversation and there’s no overarching goal for the work they do together. It always surprises me when I work with a coach who doesn’t start the engagement with coming to an understanding on what the overarching goals for our work will be. Yet, it’s happened to me over and over even with skilled coaches. This same surprise happens every time I work with an Agile coach, and they do not have an overarching agreement for the engagement. These are generally the engagements where the leaders are saying things like, “I don’t know what the coach is doing, and I don’t know what value they are adding.”  “Don't let your eagerness to show value as quickly as possible lead you to ignore this critical step,” says Michael. "Without a solid foundation, you will be guessing about what your clients want and how to work with them."  It is important that coaches understand how to manage the coaching relationship and not just one-off coaching conversations. In fact, we advise clients that they should not hire a coach who doesn’t start the relationship with a clear understanding of the focus, indicators of success, and the plan for getting there together. Coaches who understand how to hold the entire relationship are more likely to get you to the intended goal than coaches who just view each session or day at the office as a disconnected event. The relationship agreement gives structure and clarity to the engagement and ensures alignment between the parties.  With that in mind, Cherie developed a model for creating the relationship agreement. The model has been widely accepted by coaches in the Agile community who give feedback that they are using the model in their day-to-day work both as internal and external coaches. It is a model that can be used successfully with both individual and team clients and even when the client is a large organization doing Agile transformation work.  Cherie needed a consistent way to create a strong relationship agreement with her clients at the onset of an engagement. She wanted to ensure that all the important things for a successful start get covered. She needed to ensure that there was alignment on the outcomes desired by the end of the engagement. Agreeing on measurements of success and cadence of check-ins to reflect on progress and adjust overarching goals was also important to her. Through her work

she developed the STORMMES© model that provided the structure needed to ensure there was clear alignment on expectations for coaching engagement.  STORMMES© is an acronym that outlines a list of topics a coach and client should cover when co-creating their relationship. As with using any model, the only way to explain it is linearly, but it is unlikely that you will use this model in the order presented below. Instead, focus on your client and have the right conversation that covers all these topics in the order that feels the most natural. The best coaches are always responsive to client’s needs above holding tight to using any model as presented for learning purposes.   The contents in this model might be covered in one conversation or through several conversations. Some parts of this will be in your written agreement with the client and other parts will be verbal. When coaching an organization, you should have an overarching relationship agreement with the organizational client and separate relationship agreements with each team or individual you work with.  The topics covered by the acronym STORMMES© are:  S — SUBJECT: Discuss the overall focus of the coaching engagement with your client, so you can both understand what the general focus of your work will be. For example, your individual client may want to focus on their overall way of communicating with others and improve how they are perceived by higher-ranking leaders in their organization. Clients will often label this something like confidence or executive presence. A team client might want to focus on improving their delivery time or their predictability. The organizational client might have a larger general focus like, improving our ability to meet our target release dates and improve customer sentiment. This discussion will usually transition seamlessly into the M-MOTIVATION or O-OUTCOMES topics. It’s not important to follow the model in presentation order. Just ensure that your conversations cover all the topics at some point.  T — TIMEFRAMES: If you are working with organizations, some timeframes conversation will take place early on and will be included in the written legal contract. Once you get into the organization and clarify the specific goals, you will want to dig deeper into timeframes expectations. Then, with each team and individual client you will need to discuss the timeframes for your engagements.  Some of the timeframes that need to be discussed, understood, and agreed to are: ●  Engagement length — will this engagement be several weeks or months; or will it be a stated number of sessions? ● Frequency — how often will you meet with the client? Will sessions be set on a pre-defined cadence and be placed into the calendar as standing appointments or will the client book sessions as needed? What happens if the client needs to reschedule or cancel a session? What is the cancellation window, and what happens if the client misses the window? 

---

## Page 68

 
68 
● Length — how long are the coaching sessions? If the client is going to be late for the session, will the session be extended to fill the time lost, or will it be deducted from the session time? How long will the coach wait for the client before they are considered a no-show? What happens if the client is a no-show? ● Progress Check-ins — how often will the coach and client take time to reflect on progress and adjust the goals or relationship agreement? What if the client wants to make a change prior to this outlined time? What if there are concerns about the progress being made? How will conflicts between the coach and client be handled?  O — OUTCOMES: These outcomes often answer the question: What will be different at the end of our coaching engagement if we have been successful in our work together? These overarching goals are the north star for the coaching engagement.  The coach is responsible for ensuring that as the engagement progresses, the client is doing work that moves them in the direction of these intended outcomes. If not, the coach should make that transparent to the client and find out if the agreed upon goals need to change. [See chapter on Well Formed Outcomes]   R — ROLES: The conversation about roles is a critical part of co-creating the coaching relationship with the client. Agile coaches often say that they get into client engagements as a coach to find out that what the client really wants is a consultant. This is an indication that the "Roles" conversation needs strengthening.   ICF is clear that it is the coach’s responsibility to explain to their clients the difference between coaching and other disciplines and ensure that the client is clear on if they need a coach and not some other helping profession. The coach is responsible for educating the client on what the experience of coaching will be like, so the client understands what they are contracting for. When this isn’t done properly both the coach and the client are likely to be frustrated and disappointed. It is a good idea to create a checklist of sorts to ensure that you don’t forget to cover important items in the initial conversations with the client. Some things the coach should discuss with the client are listed below; however, this is not an exhaustive list.  ● Confidentiality ● Mandatory reporting ● Adherence to the ICF ethics (if the coach is an ICF credential holder) ● Client ownership of their own change and success ● Role of coach ● Role of client ● How the client can best prepare for sessions ● The importance of reflection after sessions ● Most of the work must happen between sessions ● Legal terms (often in the written contract) ● Discussing the most effective ways to communicate with one another for a successful relationship ● Any other details specific to your coaching methods and arrangements

 M — MEASURES: The "Measures" conversation often happens during or after the conversation about outcomes/goals. For each outcome, the client wants to achieve through coaching it is important to understand how they will know they have achieved it. These can sometimes be quantifiable measurements like getting the promotion they were working towards or improving their GPA by 20%.  Sometimes the client will state measures that are more quantitative in nature such as I will feel more confident. These squishy measures should be investigated further to understand things like what will be different if you are more confident? How confident are you now? Where do you want to be after our engagement? What is different about your after state from your current state?  This conversation might also outline milestones along the way to the destination which will help the coach and client see progress along the way and not only at the end of the engagement. This can help them to identify when to make shifts and adjustments along the way as necessary. [See chapters on Impact Mapping and Well-Formed Outcomes]  M — MOTIVATION: The motivation conversation is closely related to both the “SUBJECT” and “OUTCOMES” conversations. This is the “why” behind the client’s reason for engaging a coach. It’s the thing that will keep the client moving forward when things seem stalled or when it gets tough to make progress. The discussion around motivation can take the form of understanding why the goals are important to the client. What value achieving these goals will bring to the client’s life.  What will happen if the changes the client wishes to make are not achieved vs what will happen if they are achieved. What is at stake for the client or what opportunity makes the investment in coaching worth making?  Understanding the motivation for the change is important for the client to talk through because it helps them to solidify the reason they are investing in coaching and get really clear on why it is important to be committed to making the desired changes. The motivation is important for the coach to understand because it can be used to continue to point the client in the direction  E — ENVIRONMENT: The conversation about the environment can give the coach and the client valuable information and insights into the systemic factors that promote and prevent success for the client. What is happening in their environment (professional and personal) that is contributing to the ability to achieve these goals? What things in their environment (people, processes, etc.) are available to support them in moving forward? Who are the personal and professional stakeholders that need to be considered or consulted during the engagement? What about their lifestyle or environment might be a hindrance to their success? What or who can be leveraged to move the client forward?   S — START The “how to get started” conversation is one of prioritization and value assignment. What goals are most important for the client to focus on during the engagement? What is the priority order of the different goals they want to achieve? Which goals can be worked on concurrently and which might need to happen consecutively? How does the client want to

approach tackling these goals in the work together? And very importantly, where does the client want to begin the work?  Coaching engagements are more than just having a series of one-hour conversations with clients who want to talk. Engagements are about getting things accomplished and meeting goals. The client has very real reasons for seeking the assistance of a coach in meeting their goals. This model can be a helpful framework to ensure that your work with the client is set up for the client’s best success. We encourage you to utilize this model in a flexible manner to strengthen the way you co-create your coaching engagements.     Chapter 10: Goal Definition via Impact Mapping  Before digging into the nuts and bolts of the impact mapping, something needs to be said of the impact that you have when bringing a tool or a technique to an organization. This tool, impact mapping, is a square peg, and hopefully after reading this book, and maybe digging into some adjacent literature you will be able to carry this square peg in your toolbox. The fact that it’s in your toolbox will not mean that any round hole you will see is going to be a right fit for this peg to be inserted into.  Firstly, remember, you are a coach, and you are inviting your clients, enterprises, teams, and individuals to experience greater awareness. It’s they who possess greater knowledge, skills, and experiences about the inner workings of their systems. It’s they, who have the background and understanding to assess the hole, look at the peg you are holding and decide whether the two are a good fit.  This is not to suggest that you can’t introduce a tool like impact mapping if you are coaching. Of course, you can! And your clients will rightfully expect you to introduce tools, in the right context, at the right time. Part of the job is to know your tool belt and how and when to appropriately use one tool or another.  Now, the big question is, how do you know if the impact mapping tool is appropriate and when to introduce it? And the answer is, you don't. To find out, you will have to be comfortable operating in ambiguity, suggesting and holding it lightly. You will have to regard your client as knowledgeable and not in need of being fixed. Exercise the courage to run small experiments, fail and run another one. These are the skills you bring to the table that serve the client so well in the end. The impact mapping technique is both powerful and easy to use. Facilitating it through a coaching approach multiplies its power. Most impact maps you see will contain 4 parts: goals (the why), actors (the who), impacts (the how), and actions (the what). While perusing the

internet you might find some different approaches to constructing impact maps. For simplicity and consistency, we stick with this structure, described by Gojko Adžić in his book Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects8.  Part 1: Goals - The Why Usually, the process starts with identifying the goals. Well, mostly. Sometimes it does not start with the goals and that is addressed in the section of this chapter “There and Back Again.”  But for now, let’s start with goals. Let's assume this is a greenfield initiative, not littered by artifacts, outputs, or projects.  Alex says, “I won’t be wasting any electronic or physical paper for that matter to tell you how important goals are. With coaching you start with goals. Without goals coaching will lack direction, have reduced impact, and may not get the client where they want to go. Goals are the north star that will guide organizations, teams, and individuals.” David Clutterbuck in his Coaching the Team at Workbook says that, “all steps in the chain of purpose, mission, strategy, goals, and tactics require continuous attention to maintain the essential alignment.” And surely enough, impact mapping is a technique that aligns our organizations and teams around the goals with a deeper dive into the tactics of bringing those goals about. While we are starting with the goals here in the impact mapping, it is of crucial importance to understand that the purpose, mission, and strategy of organizations or teams you coach are essential inputs into the goals that you will outline in your impact map. As a matter of fact, while coaching through the goal discovery process you may find yourself asking questions like, ● What makes this goal important? ● Who says it is important? ● What will happen if we do not achieve this goal? ● When this goal is achieved what will be different for us? ● How will we know that we will have achieved the goal? As with any other questions suggested in this book, these are not intended to be a checklist of questions you need to go through to get to a clear understanding of the goals. Listen to your client, get curious, ask questions that make sense in context to help them understand their goals more fully.  Asking these types of questions will help your client to get a clearer understanding of what they want to achieve. However, no goal is worth the time spent on its creation or the paper it’s written on without a clear understanding of how to measure its achievement.  SMART goals became a staple of the goal setting process, whether in business settings, or for personal development purposes. You can find a few variations on the SMART acronym. For the purposes of this chapter, use the variation of Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound. As a coach, you can introduce this model to your client and ask relevant questions for them to decide how to smarten their goals.  In Alex’s experience the measurable part is where most teams and organizations start to experience problems in their goal setting process. There might be a few reasons for that. Until  8  https://www.amazon.com/Impact-Mapping-software-products-projects-ebook/dp/B009KWDKVA

their goals are measurable, they are just wishful thinking, squishy feel-good statements that can be bent depending on the circumstances. In organizations where people’s well-being depends on achieving the stated goals people might be reluctant to put specific numbers on them. Numbers feel real and produce pressure and make people feel like they win if they reach them and lose if they don’t. If you notice people's reluctance around putting specific numbers to the stated goals, you might get curious about the reasons for the hesitation. Coaching can enable them to identify, discuss and potentially solve those problems. It may be a worthwhile detour to take for teams to continue their goal-setting journey. Impact mapping takes a very rigorous approach to goal measurement. According to Gojko Adžić For a goal to be meaningful, it should contain the following 5 parts, 1. What is being measured. In this example, Alex’s client, an oil company, wanted to use deferred production of oil (i.e., oil they could not extract now due to downtime, or other reasons) as their measurement. Decreasing what they called deferred BOE (barrels of oil equivalent) would increase current production, and consequently, increase profitability.  2. How it will be measured. Get specific about the source of the numbers. Identify systems, sources, reports, people, where the values are coming from. For this specific example the company used an existing “Spotfire” report that was generated based on the data in the “ProCount” database.  3. The current value of the measurement (benchmark) – you will be surprised how many times your clients will have a hard time identifying the current measurement. This step cannot be skipped so taking a break to gather the benchmark measurement might be useful.  4. Minimally acceptable target value – this is the measure you will use to identify if further investment in the goal is profitable. For the minimally acceptable target value measure to be meaningful, your clients must pair it with a specific date this measure should be achieved. Such a pairing makes the pivot or persevere decision, coupled with accompanying financial decisions much easier.   In his book The Lean Startup: How Today’s Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses9, Eric Ries introduces the concept of the pivot or persevere point. This is a point in time, or in the development of a startup, project, or enterprise where people inspect the results to date and decide whether to invest more time, money, effort, and other resources in the current development or to do something else.   Alex’s oil company example used 90% as the minimally acceptable value for the deferred BOE and 3 months as our time horizon.  9   https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation-ebook/dp/B004J4XGN6/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=lean+startup&qid=1633379412&sr=8-1

 5. Optimal value – this is the outcome strived for. It might also be a value that, when achieved, will make further investments in the goals decline in value such that a shift to invest in different organizational and team goals is warranted. By coaching your clients through this process of not only making their goals SMART, but also building significant rigor into the measuring part of it, you can help them achieve more clarity around their goals. Some clients might want to build a few measurements for a single goal. For example, achieving revenue targets might be measured in a variety of ways, depending on who measures. At this point I would have put my mentor hat on and recommended against such a practice. First, it muddies the waters and creates a potential conflict not only from the pure measurement perspective but also at the pivot/persevere decision point. Second, as a coach, when clients say, “we need more metrics,” what I actually hear is, “we don’t have a clear goal, yet.” In my practice, having a single way of measuring a goal provides clarity, focus, and simplicity. You can also choose to take this part to a different level with well-formed outcomes. This, by itself, is a much deeper dive into organizational goals, capabilities, an exploration of available and needed resources. Well-formed outcomes chapter gives you a primer on the coaching approach to facilitate your client’s creation of such outcomes. Part 2: Actors - The Who Now that you have your goals clear and have a good understanding of what it will look like to achieve them, it is time to move on to defining the actors, i.e., people, groups, teams, organizations, and other entities that either help you achieve the goal or stand in your way. Yep, you read it right, not only does Alex recommend identifying your “collaborators,” i.e., those who help you achieve the goals, but also detractors.  The go-to technique for this is brainstorming. And since you likely prefer a coaching stance to all others, after explaining this impact map step, you will usually invite your clients to brainstorm.  Brainstorming is a wonderful technique often used in coaching. Brainstorming allows for a free flow of ideas. Provides a collaborative, supportive, and safe environment, where every voice is heard and no idea is dismissed as silly, outlandish, impractical, etc. The rules of brainstorming are simple and powerful. They are, ● Suspend judgment – any idea is a good idea ● Let your imagination fly – everything is possible, and nothing is impossible, ● Build off each other's ideas – we are doing it in a group setting, right? So why not to use the collective imagination to build even better ideas, ● Stay on topic – this one is a bit hairy and requires self-discipline. If someone gets off-topic in their ideas we should not be dismissing it outright as per the rules above, and it won’t be helpful for a coach to chastise the group, “stay on topic,” every time or ever the coach perceives that the ideas veer off the topic. These rules should be laid out before the exercise starts and coach should trust the client to be self-disciplined and resourceful to stay on track without coach intervention, ● One idea and conversation at a time – There are a few problems with multiple conversations at a time. First, if more than one person is talking then not enough people are listening. And brainstorming is not only about idea generation, but also listening to 

---

## Page 74

 
74 
the collective wisdom. Second, if people start talking at the same time, it is most likely they are not suggesting new ideas and building on others’ ideas, but discussing, arguing, or dismissing others’ ideas. That is not the point of brainstorming. As a coach (and a facilitator for this exercise) you may want to remind the team that they will have plenty time for discussions and debates and this is the time for generating new ideas, ● Be visual – write, draw, or sketch your idea to make it visible for everyone to see right away. That will help the rule #2 – building of each other ideas, ● The more, the merrier – encourage people to generate as many ideas as possible, don’t rush. After the first burst people need more time to get into something that they have never thought of. This is the time for the proverbial AWE (And What Else) question.  And there your clients go to the races – piling up some great ideas and uncovering hopefully a multitude of actors who help or detract from achieving the goals. This is the awareness step of the exercise, this is what coaching is all about – discovering something new or looking at something already known from a different angle to get a new perspective. Can you contribute to the brainstorming session other than facilitating the process move forward? You can, carefully. One of the worst things the coach can do when asked for their opinion is to say, “well, I am a coach, and it’s not my place to have an opinion,” or something along those lines. Yes, you do have an opinion, and if you are in a familiar environment, you probably have some insights to share with your clients, whether these insights come from observing this very client, or from your previous engagements and work you have done. However, there are two things you want to be mindful of when giving insights as a coach. Be wary and aware of your power position – whether real or perceptual. Remember that coaching is an equal partnership where no one is above any other party involved. If your clients perceive you as superior to them in knowledge, skills, competencies, and influence they might start giving your inputs much more deference than those inputs deserve. They may also diminish the value of their own ideas. “I have seen this happen many times during coaching engagements, particularly when the Agile coach is a former manager,” says Michael. “This is a trap that causes client disempowerment.” A power token attached to an idea, regardless of how good it is, makes that idea unfairly influential on the one hand, and comes with the “not my idea” pushback on the other. As Sara Smith, an ICF Board Chair, said during a podcast with Cherie and Alex, “tell them what to do, and you engage their left, rational brain. They will write it down, execute on it with much less thought they otherwise would give an idea, and come back for more.” That is not our goal in coaching. We want them to come up with the ideas, and own the execution without external selling, pushing, and threatening with consequences. Hence, there are two rules around your contribution as a coach to the brainstorming content. First, never volunteer your ideas first or succumb to being pushed to go first. People are never so stuck that they cannot come up with a single idea. What they might be having are thoughts that their ideas are not worthy of consideration, so they shut themselves down and defer to you. You probably see that the problem here is not that they can’t have any ideas, but that more safety, openness, and respect are needed. That’s the job for a coach. That’s where you should put most of your effort to enable people to speak freely. Work on that and you might never need to volunteer your ideas to start with. Second, if you do give your ideas and contribute to the common pile of thoughts, make sure these ideas are treated the same as others. The coaching term for this is to hold your ideas 

---

## Page 75

 
75 
lightly, contribute them with no attachment. While holding your ideas lightly is a nice concept, it’s hard not to be invested in your own ideas. If you are an expert in a specific area and this idea revolves around the area of your expertise, it’s even harder. And that’s where your coaching training and competencies should come into play. It is not about you; it is never about you. It is about them and their outcomes. So please contribute your ideas, while helping create an open, collaborative, and safe environment, and do so with no attachment to your contributions. Lastly, why should you waste any time with identifying detractors? The idea here is not to put detractors on the map and figure out how to work around them but to create more awareness about them. Identifying detractors can help you think about supporters who counterweigh the detractors' problems, concerns, and hesitations. These supporters are the people who help push ideas through and get things done. Those counterbalancing individuals should also be on your map. The idea is to focus on the interests of the counterbalancing supporters as they are working towards the same impact rather than against it. These supporters are the people whose interests you want to explore, amplify, and protect. This will help remove and diminish the effects of the detractors. Thus, identifying detractors is an intermediary step that you might take to get even deeper into identifying the real actors behind the goals.       Part 3: Impacts - The How  Now that you sorted through your actors and picked those you wanted to put on the map, you dig into the actions they take, regularly or one-off, to achieve the goals identified in the first step. You can use the same brainstorming technique described above. In my experience, this part does not always require a deep dive, however, you want to make sure that the discovery process doesn’t shift to assigning blame and making judgments. The purpose of designing the impact map is to help clients move forward towards achieving the goals, rather than telling everyone how poor of a job someone else does.  As you are working through the impact discovery process, you might want to pay particular attention to which impacts are real and which are desirable. Identify which impacts are performed today, and which are those the client would like to have, but don’t have now. If some impacts are those that your clients want to implement, but never

had time, funding, or people, encourage them to put those impacts on the map and mark them as future or desired impacts. This will provoke more insightful, aspirational, and hard conversations. It will give your client a fuller picture of how they might approach achieving their goals. Here we come to one of the most curious outcomes of the impact mapping. A lot of these conversations in the Agile world start around a piece of software, or a piece of a product, which has software at its core. However, what I found many times is that by the time we get to the impacts, some non-software pieces start sprouting up here and there. I have seen a spectrum of reactions from people when they see these effects coming around, surprise, excitement, annoyance, and even anxiety. As a coach you should pay particular attention to these reactions as they might make or break the outcomes of the exercise. Some might be thinking (or saying), “we never thought about it that way,” which is a fertile ground for an exploration towards the possibilities these new ways of thinking open. Others might say, “That will never work, it’s outside of our area of control, let’s get real.” Resist the urge to heed these voices. Having a comprehensive impact map with visibility into inner workings of the organization that are usually hidden or perceived out of reach is indispensable in gaining a better understanding of what the next level of performance might be. Part 4: Actions - The What And lastly, we arrive at a point where we can start asking the question, “What do we do to support the actions identified in the previous step for actors to achieve the goals?” In this step coaching will depend on your client readiness to make decisions and the stage of the process they are in. In many cases, when Alex ran this exercise, the client already had a few ideas of what they wanted to do with the product. They wanted a framework that would help them to put those ideas into a bigger picture. If this is the case, you will have quite a few good ideas and you will start seeing them sorted out to help with specific actions your actors take. If you run the exercise from scratch, and the organization does not have any notion of what they would like the product or a set of actions be, your coaching process through this step might resemble those prior steps, i.e., another brainstorming exercise with a focus on supporting specific actions.  As you transition to coaching this step, it is a good idea to take a step back and take in the whole picture that the map presents so far. You might want to ask the following types of questions to deepen the conversation, ● What do you see?  ● What stands out? ● What surprises you? ● What about the process has prompted most thinking and reflection? ● Where can the most impact be achieved in the least amount of time? These are just some sample questions. Of course, you will be coaching your client considering their context, process, and content, so make sure your questions are customized for their environment.

In many cases you will have an opportunity to work on a greenfield initiative, or with newly formed teams, or with organizations that are willing to start from scratch. But what if you must work with teams that have existing initiatives underway? What if the organization tasks you with helping them make sense of the existing portfolio landscape?  You can still start, as described above, from goal definition and follow the impact mapping process. As we stated before, identifying purpose, mission, strategy, goals and tactics for organizations and teams has its own inherent value and people will benefit from the clarity these activities bring. You can also start from the bottom (or depending on the orientation of your map, from the right), trying to fit in the existing solutions and identify which actions they support. The types of questions you might ask are, ● When we implement this, who will it support? ● What difference will it make in their lives? ● How impactful is it going to be? ● What will it enable them to do they cannot do now? You might want to ask questions about actors, their actions, efficiency and effectiveness of their actions, their daily routines and changes these solutions will introduce (hopefully for the best). As you are having this conversation with your clients you will start noticing that branches of the map start taking shape. Note down actors and their actions and start attaching solutions to those branches. Do not forget the goals those actors pursue – as this will give your client important measures and metrics as to which direction to grow the map further.  Hold all the ideas and map structures lightly. The impact map is not supposed to be a plan that your client rigidly executes. It is a living and breathing document that prompts a conversation and helps with important decision-making processes. A comprehensive impact map can help to answer the following questions, ● I have this great idea of a new feature – should we implement it? ● Are we focusing our limited resources on the right goal? ● Do our focus and efforts bring results? Bring enough results? Bring timely results? ● How do we know which goals are important and which ones should we focus on next? ● How do we align people and resources around organizational goals so that they have a better understanding of why we do what we do and what is coming next? A comprehensive and well thought out impact map will help you ask and answer these and many other questions that are integral to the success of your client’s enterprise. What Can You Use It For? The beauty of impact mapping is its simplicity and versatility. With limited effort you can help clients get new clarity around a variety of issues.  Of course, since most of the Agile practice revolves around creating complex products, that is the area where impact mapping is arguably applied most. As described below it can be used for greenfield initiatives, where your clients might only have vague ideas of what goals they are trying to achieve with the proposed products and solutions. At the same time, those undertakings that are well underway can benefit from impact mapping as well.

Alex has successfully applied impact mapping to bring clarity to product development in information technology, financial industry, oil and gas, and education. While it is convenient and expedient to only involve product owners in this exercise, there are immense benefits in including the whole product development team. Remember the saying, “no one resisted the change they helped co-design.” Getting input and involving your developers at this level will help the organization to design better products and benefit from the creativity and ingenuity of smart and highly paid people. Alex also ran a workshop for an executive team that was during transforming its development organization which included product, development, and operations. They were looking for better ways of supporting their teams on this complex journey. They started with a goal of successful transformation and defined a few metrics that would allow them to make important financial and organizational decisions as they were progressing with the initiative.  Then, they mapped out all the involved actors. In this case not only those were the teams directly involved in the transformation, but also executives from other functions, such as finance, marketing, and talent management, that were crucial to the success of the transformation. Identifying actors whose actions potentially would make or break the undertaking gave this executive team a lot of clarity and focus into actions they should be implementing to ensure the success of the whole initiative. Having identified all these external actors helped the executive team to empathize better with those individuals. They were able to better understand their involvement in the process and design their own actions. Some of those actions were more involvement, regular communications and updates, and better transparency to help move this complex initiative forward. The last example is probably the most interesting. A team Alex worked with used impact mapping to understand what it takes to be a high performing team. Their goal was defined as, “to become a high performing team,” and they identified a few metrics that would tell them they met their goal. These were delivery, learning, and relationship targets that would validate the team to be high performing according to its members. What the team decided to do next was different from a standard impact mapping approach. They identified each team member as an actor, as well as broad groups of members, such as designers, ops, and developers. Working diligently through actions of these actors towards the goal of becoming a high performing team revealed a lot to the team. It revealed the way its individual members were thinking and yielded several very fruitful conversations about how the team operated. Ultimately, it helped all the team members understand their present state and what it would take to get where they all wanted to be. In the last step the team co-designed together actions that would help individuals and functional groups within the team be more effective and focused on their way of becoming a high-performing team. Alex shares, “My sincere hope is that after reading this detailed description of the impact mapping technique and getting some ideas from the use cases about how you can coach teams through it, this tool will take its rightful place in your Agile coaching tool belt.”

The Problem – Remedy – Outcome Coaching Sequence   Individuals, teams, and organizations alike struggle to work towards clear outcomes. This is not for a reason that those clear outcomes are hard to imagine or come by. It is primarily for the reason of the hectic and ever-changing environment they operate in. Sometimes in the hustle and bustle of the day we start mistaking efficiency for effectiveness.  Alex shares, “I cannot tell you how many times I heard from my clients, ‘I need to use every minute of my day with purpose, I need to get more efficient with using my time.’  As I am listening to another client saying that I become immensely curious, what this efficiency will give them and what difference it will make in their lives? At the same time, the most effective individuals, teams, and organizations I met, worked with, and coached were laser focused on being effective in everything they do, whether mundane day-to-day tasks, or striving in achieving long-term goals. Hustle and bustle were their sworn enemies, and they did everything in their power to keep those enemies at bay. Only after succeeding at that, through a variety of ways, like automation for development teams, effective delegation for executives, clear understanding of objectives to be achieved through well-defined key results, could they effectively focus on what matters.” The most effective teams are always able to verbalize and, most importantly, visualize their goals and outcomes. Sensory acuity, which will be discussed a bit later, is one of the key factors to creating and maintaining well-formed outcomes. By hearing, seeing, and feeling the results of their labor teams capable of realizing the importance of the tasks at hand and goals ahead of them.  So where do you start as coaches? You start where your clients are, of course. Go to their bus stop and invite them to take a ride! And what kind of a ride is that? It depends on what you hear in their communication. This chapter introduces a simple technique that you can use with your clients to help them clearly understand their goals and the outcomes these goals will bring about. Active listening is an integral part of any coaching engagement, session, and a core competency of any professional coach. By using focused and global listening you hear not only what is said, but also what is communicated. You hear the details that words cannot portray fairly and accurately. Luckily, this technique does not require you to listen on those higher levels, all you need to be doing is listening intently to what is said.  PRO - Problem, Remedy, Outcomes Method Imagine your client comes to a session and vents, “They never listen! Or they only listen to themselves. They talk, talk, talk non-stop, and never get to doing anything. That is totally pathetic.” Think for a moment about what you hear. Venting – of course, frustration, moaning, and a few other words come to mind. You hear a lot of displeasure and things they don’t like. Things are pathetic! Notice what is missing – a desire or wish to change anything, something. Of course, you hear that unspoken desire, “I want them to just stop talking!” however it would be a stretch to assume that those are the desires of your client.

 Everything that is happening there is happening now, and, probably, happening constantly, hence so much frustration and almost exasperation! What you hear there is the manifestation and description of a problem. The problem that your client identified (and supposedly wants to get rid of).  Here’s another similar example, “I don’t need their attitude! I am sick and tired of going round and round! They never listen, and when they do, they do not do what I want. Ever!” Sounds like a problem. However, at this point you don’t know what your client wants, if anything, besides to vent. You can help your client start untangling this problem by asking a simple and a very powerful question that utilizes a variation of a Clean Language10 question and technique.  Client: I don’t need their attitude! I am sick and tired of their antics! Coach: And when that happens, what would you like to happen instead? (Well, to be fair, if you are coaching that client, you probably would start with acknowledging their frustration, but that’s a different topic.) Notice what this question does. It shifts the client's focus from the complaints to the direction of her desires. A pure Clean Language question would have sounded like, “And when, attitude, and their antics, what would you like to have happened?” Weird, isn’t it? Let’s not do it. A simple plain language variation works better in an organizational setting. What you are asking here, in a polite and non-dismissive way, is for the client to describe their desires and wishes. If the client is at the problem level, they are not ready to be thinking about outcomes, so you are asking for a solution to their problem, for a remedy. Client: I just want them to shut up for a change and listen for once! Great, this is progress. The client is verbalizing the remedy they want. They are describing what the alternative might be like. In that world, their colleagues, family members, friends, or some other people would stop doing all the talking and start listening instead.  The client doesn’t always start a conversation with the problem. Sometimes they might start a conversation with a remedy. They might start like this, “I want to talk about my colleagues who are always talking and never listen, and I want them to shut up and listen for a change!” When you hear a remedy, you will instantly recognize a desire, need, or want to have more or less of something – more of being listened to in this case, or more of their colleagues keeping quiet, or less of their colleagues incessant talking! Also notice that the client manages to squeeze the problem and a solution in the same sentence. And while doing that, they imagine some future in which their desired state will be achieved. What is missing here though are the results and deeper understanding of that future state. In the desired future, the colleagues will be talking less and listening more. The big coaching question still waiting for an answer is, “So... what?”  The client is still a step away from stating the outcomes they desire clearly. And your job is to help them take that last step. Here is another modified Clean Language question to use to move them forward,  10 If you want to learn more about Clean Language, its roots, uses, and structures, we recommend Clean Language: Revealing Metaphors and Opening Minds by Wendy Sullivan and Judy Rees.

Client: I want them to stop talking and talking and start listening! Coach: And when they stop talking and start listening, then what happens? Another version of this question would ask, “And when they stop talking and start listening, what happens next?” You can use whichever version sounds better to you. Notice what this question does. It assumes that the desired state is reached. Now what? What do you experience there? What is different for you? What is it like for you to be in your desired state? Now the client can start thinking about what is possible when the desired state is achieved, and what might their next steps be.  Coach: And when they stop talking and start listening, then what happens? Client: Well, hm, then those on the teams who have opinions but had no chance to voice them will be heard and because of that we might be able to make better decisions! Now your client starts talking! Now they are realizing what is there, beyond their wish for those people to stop talking and how that will benefit them and those around them. This is the outcome they want. Not perfect, and not well-formed, but still an outcome that provides much more clarity and awareness to your client than an emotionally charged problem or a wish lacking a clear understanding of the consequences. This outcome contains a desire for something beneficial for your client, their environment, and those in it. This outcome projects in the future and, most importantly, it lacks any reference to the problem.  Having helped your client to arrive at this outcome you can help them to gain more clarity around it, and that we will discuss in a bit. What is also possible here is to create a loop with solutions and guide your client through a decision-making routine. Having a clear outcome enables your client to step back, put aside the remedy they came up with, and think about other solutions, actions, and decisions they can take to achieve the desired outcome. The coach can help them flesh out the desired outcomes using another set of Clean Language questions, such as, And when you are making better decisions, what kind of better is that better? Is there anything else about those better decisions? Those better decisions are like what? Again, these are modified Clean Language questions and do not follow the original questions word for word or observe the prescribed structure. However, these are more suited for working with your enterprise client in a professional environment without weirding them out.  And while these questions are powerful and will serve their purpose of bringing more clarity and understanding of the outcome to your client, there’s a better and a more powerful way to coach around outcomes. That way is to make them well formed.  Developing Well-Formed Outcomes  A well-formed outcome is defined as a desired future state that is specific, measurable, and achievable. A well-formed outcome can be incorporated into a business plan to create a timeline and guide day-to-

day work. Well-formed outcomes can also be used for personal goals such as setting up new habits or changing long standing behaviors. Coaches in their natural state of engaged neutrality are uniquely equipped to help their clients, whether individual or groups, to define, shape, and achieve these outcomes. To put it plainly, a well-formed outcome is forward looking, defined clearly and plainly, and free of “muddy thinking.” You can use well-formed outcomes as a tool to help your client create positive change in their lives. If they have a goal that they want to achieve, it's important to clearly define what it is they want to accomplish and how they are going to do it. A well-formed outcome creates the necessary clarity by helping them focus on what needs to happen for the goal to be achieved. Well-formed outcomes are SMART and PURE11. You probably have heard about SMART goals before. It is an acronym that specifies the qualities a goal should have. In a variety of sources these components are referred to as Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound. PURE is an additional concept. By bringing it about and working through it we can help turn SMART goals into well-formed outcomes. PURE includes the following components, Positive terms, Under Control, Right sized and doable, and Ecological. As you might be noticing, the techniques being described in this chapter will call upon many core coaching competencies outlined by the International Coaching Federation since these are Professional Coaching methods that can be utilized in your work as an Agile Coach. By bringing professional coaching competencies like active listening, direct communication, and coaching presence into your work as an Agile Coach you are better positioned to help your client have the strongest outcomes possible from the coaching engagement.  As you build out your outcomes with your client keep in mind that it’s more of a circular than linear process. You might circle back and make updates to a part you’ve already covered, and you might cover multiple parts in one step.

 To ensure that your outcomes are well-formed there are nine conditions that the outcomes must meet: 1. Stated in positive terms (focuses on what you want -not what you don’t want) 2. As specific as possible 3. Measurable through sensory and evidence-based conditions 4. Within your control (Something you can do. Not what you want someone else to do) 5. Considers the context in which the outcome should be true (has appropriate scope) 6. Must have access to the resources required to reach the outcome (time, budget, people, supplies, tools, etc.) 7. Preserves existing benefits  8. Ecologically sound 9. Defined first steps  Conditions #1: Well-formed outcomes are stated in positive terms  Do not mistake the “positive terms'' condition for dragging the clients down the warm and fuzzy road of thinking positively. This is different. Stating an outcome in positive terms provides clarity of thought around the desire our clients have. Language has a great power over our ways of thinking. Do a mental experiment. Concentrate and tell yourself, “Do not think of a pink elephant.” If you are brutally honest with yourself, have you had a fleeting image of a weird pink elephant going through your mind? If not, you are in the minority. What we do by stating our wishes in negative terms, we make our minds and ourselves to think about the things that we don’t want. We inadvertently keep them front and center, thus making it so much harder to get them out of sight, out of mind. Suppose you want to forget the pink elephant and focus on thinking about a purple gorilla. Instead of telling you, “Do not think about a pink elephant.” (Negative term) It is more effective to tell you, “Think about a purple gorilla.” (Positive term) The same rule applies to parenting. Oftentimes parents tell their children what they don’t want them to do (and inadvertently put ideas in their minds), rather than making their wishes clear through verbalizing what the desired behaviors and outcomes are. In NLP12, this concept is referred to as towards and away from language patterns. Let’s get back to coaching though. By now, you hopefully realize that stating outcomes in unequivocally positive terms will help your clients move forward without unneeded distractions. An interesting parallel here can be drawn with an exercise a lot of Agile coaches (and trainers) are doing – Stop/Start/More of/Less of. Alex says, “I would argue that each and every entry on the stop list should have a matching entry on the Start list, otherwise the request will have a problem and no remedy or outcome.” PRO13 coaching is also highly applicable in a situation where your client states the problem, or outcomes in a negative, or “away from” terms. The questions like, “When you don't have [x] what would you like to have happen?” or “What would you like to have instead?” will help to provide a much needed reframe to the outcome your client desires and focus their mind on the goal ahead of them rather than something undesirable they are trying to get away from. Here are some examples of positive reframes,  12 Neuro-Linguistic Programming 13 https://cleanlanguage.co.uk/articles/blogs/104/The-Evolution-of-the-Problem-Remedy-Outcome-PRO-Model.html

Instead of: “We need to do a round of layoffs” Try: “We need to increase our margins” Instead of: “We need to stop missing the deadlines” Try: “We need to deliver when our customers expect” Instead of: “Our retrospectives are a snooze fest of what went well, what went wrong, what needs to be changed” Try: “Let’s get engagement back into retrospectives” The process of helping a client develop well-formed outcomes is a coaching process. We suggest that you explain the concept of well-formed outcomes to the client and make it transparent rather than trying to pick their outcomes from the conversation. You want to have them take ownership of developing the outcomes while you coach them through the process of thinking about the outcomes they want to achieve. The outcomes the client wants to achieve must be outcomes within their own control. For example, if the client wants “to make sure my sister can be a doctor” this is not in the control of the client. The sister is the one who must want to be a doctor and do the work it takes to get there. When you dig in further the client likely wants to provide her sister with the opportunities and support, she needs to go to medical school. This is something the client can control. We’ll go deeper into Condition #2 a little further down the road. We’ll follow three examples through the process so you can see how they might be formulated. We will assume that these clients are walking through the PRO process and having a coaching conversation that’s not being recorded in the example. Keep in mind that the examples shown here are simplistic and your client’s world will be very different and likely more complex. It may take a few sessions to work through developing outcomes; especially if they are very large and end up having several sub-outcomes that they will need to accomplish along the way to their ultimate end state. Notice how the outcomes morph as we walk through the relevant conditions and refine them.  *********Grey Box***********  Conditions #1: Stated in positive terms  Examples:  Individual Client:  Problem - College is expensive and I don't want my children to go into debt to get an education. Remedy - Make sure there is money available to pay for their education, so they don’t need loans Outcome - I want to be able to fully fund up to three college educations by the time my children reach college age.

Problem - Our budget for consulting is way overspent. We’re bleeding money. We will not survive another 3 years if we don’t do something soon. Remedy - Bring the consulting talent in-house and stop paying external consultants. Outcome - We want to increase our free cash flow (FCF) via budget controls  Organizational Team-level Client: Problem - Our budget for consultant coaches is being cut. We need coaches and our funding will be cut over the next three years by ¼ of our current allocation. Remedy - We need to build an in-house coaching program and bring the coaching talent in house so we won’t be so dependent on consultants. Outcome - We want to develop in-house coaching competency that can support the company’s coaching needs. **********Grey Box***********     Conditions 2 & 3: Specific and are measurable by Sensory Acuity   Specificity of the desired outcome is a key to be able to start on a path of bringing about those outcomes. When the desired outcome is defined in clear terms, our clients will better know what actions they need to be taking to achieve them. A favorite quote from the Cheshire Cat fits well here, “If you don’t know where you are going, any road will take you there.” It does not matter which actions you are taking, or which decisions you are making, if you don’t have a clear outcome in mind.  One method of getting the outcomes more specific is to use NLP techniques to deal with 3 chief reasons for Meta Model Violations – Generalizations, Distortions, and Deletions14. We won't go into detail about all the techniques that are applicable here, you can find much-detailed discussions in fantastic works by NLP creators Bandler and Grinder and others. Another way to achieve required specificity and measurability of the outcomes is to help the clients achieve a requisite level of sensory acuity. A person's level of sensory acuity is equal to the capacity they must be acutely aware through their senses.  Human beings have five well-defined and studied representational systems, ways that experiences are represented in our minds, that comprise an acronym VAKOG. That stands for Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic, Olfactory, and Gustatory. In the corporate world people tend to communicate through the first three. However olfactory and gustatory systems might come into play with well-formed outcomes if the client perceives the world best through them. They may also come into play if smell and taste are an  14   https://www.nlpworld.co.uk/nlp-training-meta-model/

86 
important part of the environment in which the client functions. For example, you might coach a restaurant owner, pastry chef, perfume maker, medical professional, police officer, cleaning professional, etc.  Every human being has a preferred representational system (in rarer case two of them). The core idea of NLP – neuro-linguistic programming – is that our words, and language as a whole, is a great window into our inner world, and specifically, the way we perceive it. Our communication betrays the preferred representational system we use in our daily lives. You, as a coach, will serve your client well if you recognize their preferred representational system and form your interventions, questions, and thoughts through the lens of that system. Developing a well-formed outcome, in other words involves helping your clients realize how to identify measurable progress through their representational systems – VACOG – what the world around them will, correspondingly, look, sound, and feel like when they arrive at their intended destination. This process is called achieving sensory acuity of the outcome. The questions that you might explore with your clients here will be, “What will you see differently when you are done?” “When this is achieved, what will you hear others saying?” “What will it feel like to finally arrive at this outcome?” Depending on the person and the nature of the work being done with the client, you might also ask, “What will you smell in the air when you achieve this?” “What will you taste when this is complete?”   Do not skimp on this important work, however awkward it might feel for you and your client. Having a strong sensory acuity of the desired outcome not only provides a clear understanding of what it might look like when implemented, but also serves as an additional motivator (or in rare cases demotivator) for your client to move forward. Creating these mental images of success helps them to continuously connect to what it will be like when they have achieved the outcomes they want.   *********Grey Box***********  Conditions: #2 Specific - #3 Measurable by Sensory Acuity  Individual Client:  Positive Outcome - I want my children to have a fully funded college education  Specific - I want to have enough money saved in my children’s college fund for them to pay all their tuition, books, and boarding for up to 6 years at a state college.  Measurable -  ● I will feel at peace when it is time for them to start shopping for colleges ● I won’t worry about how my children will pay for college while they are in high school ● I won’t fear that if my children don’t get scholarships or grants, they won’t be able to go to school ● I will see all three of my children graduate from college ● I will hear their names called at graduation ceremonies ● I will see that they have no student loans to pay off

● I will feel proud when they are able to start their adult lives with no education debt  Organizational Leadership Team Client:  Positive Outcome - We want to increase our free cash flow (FCF)  Specific - We want to increase our free cash flow by 12% over the next three years by redirecting the current consulting budget to FCF.  Measurable -  ● We will observe the annual budget and expenditure for consulting reduce yearly for a period of three years ● We will see our FTE cost rise for roles formerly held by consultants increase at a rate less than our current consulting costs ● We will hear that the competency of our staff is comparable to that of the current consultants ● We will feel relieved when we don’t have huge consulting bills to pay  Organizational Team-level Client: Positive Outcome - We need in house coaching competency that can support the company’s coaching needs. Specific - We will have a highly competent centralized coaching function that has the responsibility for the hiring, development, and alignment for coaching needs throughout the company without dependence on external consultants. Measurable -  ● We will hear the departments with coaches say that the quality of our internal coaches is comparable to that of the consultant coaches ● We will see that we have proper job descriptions, hiring practices, and compensation in place to hire competent coaches ● We will feel confident that we can serve the company’s coaching needs well when we have experienced coaches on staff ● We will experience the training and program being in operation and will see newer coaches building competency over time  **********Grey Box*********** Well-formed outcomes should be attractive and motivational   There’s nothing new or groundbreaking about the concept that goals should be attractive and motivating. And motivation is hard. Time and time again we see clients setting lofty goals that sound great in theory. However, those goals are simply attractive words without a clear destination and solid

steps towards implementing them. Accomplishing any worthwhile goal requires effort via the expenditure of mental, physical, and psychological energies. Human beings are programmed by nature to conserve all those energies, if possible, for those critical moments where such expenditure is highly warranted, i.e., running away from a saber tooth tiger or a bear. Hopefully none of the goals you will encounter with your clients include those animals unless you are coaching zoo or national park personnel. That leaves you and your client with the fundamental question of where they should go to find that motivation; what might compel their pre-programmed nature to expend precious energy and move towards achieving the goal. There is no clear-cut answer to this important question. However, there are a few techniques you can deploy to help the client find their real motivation.  Perceptual Positions Coaching Since the well-formed outcomes concept comes from the field of neuro-linguistic programming, let’s first look at what that field has to offer us in terms of motivation.   We have already talked about the sensory acuity that allows the client to “experience” their desired outcomes by utilizing their representational system modalities. You can also help them to experience their desired end state by utilizing perceptual positions to understand what it will be like when they have success from multiple perspectives, theirs, others involved, neutral third parties, and the larger system. ● First perceptual position is the client and deals with how the client sees, feels, and acts in this specific situation.  ● Second perceptual position is that of the client’s opponent. The word opponent is used quite loosely here to signify any other party to the situation, conversation, conflict, or other association. The second perceptual position deals with the perception of the other party in the same situation, including the way they perceive the client’s behaviors and contributions to it.  As you coach the client through the second perceptual position, encourage them to disassociate themselves from their own position in the situation and associate with their opponent. This will enable them to engage in more empathy and awareness of the situation.  ● Third perceptual position is that of an independent observer. We ask our client to disassociate themselves from all the parties of the situation, take the stance of a fly on the wall, and see it through the eyes of those who have no stake in the game. What does the situation look like if you were to look at it from a side and had no interest in resolving it one way or another?  ● Fourth perceptual position deals with the larger system as it views all the positions from afar at the same time and can observe things like the micro and macro impacts to the wider system. Thus, asking the client to take various positions not only allows them to understand the situation, in this case their goal more fully, but also find those points they like and dislike about them. As the client's awareness grows, they might come across some very attractive qualities of the situation and discover the real motivation they want to employ to achieve these goals.  As you and the client talk through these representational systems and perceptual positions, it is important to take time to have the client reflect on what new insights they have. They will want to take some of these insights forward to use them and others they want to dispose of.  Values Coaching

Values coaching is another tool you can deploy to help the client fully understand or even find their motivation. Connecting the goals to their values, or, even better, core values – those that are core to their being, is a powerful way to help the client see whether the goal is worth their time and energy to pursue. It would be a shame for the client to set their site on the goal, invest considerable resources and then realize that the goal and the state that results from its implementation contradict their values. In the context of Agile Coaching, the client can be an individual or a system such as a group of people, a team, an organization, or the whole company. When we work with systems, they are considered a single entity. Cherie refers to these as multi-person clients. Values work goes directly to the top of the Dilts Pyramid15 of Logical Levels, not only touching upon the values and beliefs, but, most likely, to the very sense of self, identity, and purpose of the human being (or organization) in front of you. Working at this level is both impactful and fulfilling, as the changes at the top of the pyramid – to the purpose, identity, values, beliefs – will almost inevitably result in a chain reaction and many changes at the bottom levels of the pyramid – environment, behaviors, and competencies and capabilities.  As we are working with organizations, the question of motivation becomes more pronounced and acute, since it is the system – the team, the department, and the organization itself that must align around a set of motivational goals. That system has many variables and parts that do not all think, feel, or behave alike. While coaching the system, the coach needs to zoom out and observe the system a bit out of focus. That allows the coach to step back from hearing many different voices and get a sense of the agreement or disagreement that emerges in the system.  As an Agile coach, the values you coach around might be corporate values and how the outcomes the client desires are out of alignment with those values. When working with sub-systems, you might coach around organizational values or Agile values and principles.   Conditions # 4, 5 & 6: Under client’s control, content and scope, resources To be well-formed, the outcomes must be completely under client’s control. The client should have the power, authority, and control to be able to implement the actions and realize the benefits of the outcomes. The desired outcomes cannot be dependent on someone else’s performance that is outside of the client’s control.  At the same time the client should be the one who initiated the outcome and is fully invested in benefits it will provide.  Earlier we mentioned this example of an individual’s outcome being under their own control: If the client wants “to make sure my children graduate from the best colleges in the country” this is not in the control of the client. The children are the ones who must do the work it takes to get there. When you dig in further the client likely wants to provide her children with the opportunities and support, they need to go to the best colleges in the country. This is something the client can control.  Generating under control and self-initiated outcomes is probably one of the hairiest parts of the well-formed outcomes when used at the organizational or team level. As you might see this approach can present a few challenges when working with organizations and teams within those organizations. When  15   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z87fGbtSJFY

you are working at the enterprise level, self-initiation is less of an issue. At the very top level the initiatives are mostly self-initiated. Strategic initiatives are developed at the enterprise level and flow down to the organizations & teams who must decide what they will do to contribute to the execution of the strategy.  Even at the enterprise level, the problem to solve, improvement to make, or outcomes they decide to pursue will not likely be completely self-initiated. The desired outcomes are more likely to be responses to market forces, external factors, or may be internal initiatives that seem to be useful for moving the client in the right direction. There can be an infinite number of sources that serve as a motivation and inspiration for the client to embark on this journey.  What self-initiation means is that the client employs their own agency and willingness to design and put their energy and resources behind the goals and outcomes they desire. Well-formed outcomes can’t be designed and handed over to someone to achieve. They must be generated by the person wanting the outcomes and who will be the one doing the work. This goes to the heart of the motivation discussed previously. If outcomes can’t be handed down for someone to do, the conflict between organizational goals and internal teams trying to create their own well-formed outcomes must be resolved. When the goals and outcomes are created by someone else in the C-suite, it seems to be a non-starter for the teams to adopt the intended outcomes as their own well-formed ones.  This is really a question of considering the context of the outcomes. The C-Suite in this case must decide if the outcomes (and likely sub outcomes since enterprise initiatives are generally very large) are to be fully under C-Suite control and how far the scope of the work they want to do will extend. They get to decide the boundaries. If this was an individual and their goal was to be more courageous and outspoken, they would get to decide the scope. Who do they want to be more courageous and outspoken with? In what context is the outcome to be true. Do they want to be more courageous and outspoken every day and with everyone they encounter, or just with certain people and in certain circumstances? For the C-Suite they decide how much control they want and how far that control reaches.  There are two possible scenarios in play: Let's say the C-Suite develops a set of well-formed outcomes they want to achieve. They outline sub-outcomes that need to be met if the ultimate outcomes are to be achieved.  In Scenario #1 The C-Suite decides that they want to have full control of the entire set of activities and sub-outcomes that need to be met to achieve the ultimate outcome. While this is a very expensive and very slow way to work, it puts them in control, and they own the outcomes. In this case, the team is handed a well-formed outcome (sub-outcome) and told to execute it. The team didn’t design the outcome; they are simply a necessary resource needed to execute the tasks needed to arrive at the intended outcome. In this case, because the team does not own the outcome and doesn’t have control, they become just a tool to complete the work. There likely won’t be tons of motivation to see the ultimate outcome achieved - they may not even fully understand the larger picture of the outcome. There is likely to be lots of rework and change controls. There will probably be a lot of process and reporting required. [Sounds a bit like a waterfall project, doesn’t it?] The team will be motivated to do their own part so they can be successful but aren’t very invested in the higher goals. In this scenario the team does not have well-formed outcomes. They have orders from above that they are following so

someone else can achieve their own well-formed outcomes. In this scenario the context (scope) is under the C-Suite’s purview. They have decided that the scope of the outcomes they want to achieve are all subject to the control of the C-Suite and they have not limited their involvement.  Scenario 2: The C-Suite determines the outcomes and identifies the sub-outcomes that need to be true to get the outcomes they desire. They decide that they will present the sub-outcomes to the organizations/teams in their purview and problems for the organizations/teams to solve. In this case, the team will be handed the sub-outcomes and given control to figure out how they will solve the challenge. In this case, the teams will be well served by creating their own version of outcomes that they can stand behind fully, that have all the attributes of well-formed outcomes and that drive the organization towards the bigger goals. As each team creates their own outcomes that will contribute to the ultimate outcome of the company, they each have autonomy to solve the problems they take ownership of. The alignment of results, expectations, and ways of working while keeping the bigger enterprise outcome in mind and checking their results against it will keep various work groups from veering off course.  Which brings us to another challenge that we see in our work with organizations throughout industries – work dependencies. The well-formed outcomes approach is clear – in order for the outcome to be well-formed those who desire and work towards such an outcome should not be dependent on anyone else but themselves to get to the outcome.  Dependencies The moment they identify any dependency on an outside intervention they don’t have control over, they need to reconsider the scope, approach, methods of achieving the outcome or the combination thereof. A lot of best and brightest Agile minds are fighting with the ideas of identifying and managing dependencies and a few major approaches are emerging. Examples of these approaches include managing the dependencies (SAFe), eliminating the dependencies (Scrum@Scale), and restructuring (LeSS). A masterful Agile coach can be indispensable during the process of realizing, surfacing, identifying, and shedding light on such dependencies. Identifying dependencies requires a concerted effort from teams, stakeholders, and organizations. Some dependencies exist on the organizational level and working within their parameters or mitigating their impact sometimes requires involvement of the management up to the C-suite.  An example of such dependency might be an outdated or excessively rigid funding process for the initiatives whereas the approval process might involve multiple levels of stakeholders. Such a process does not lend itself to any well-formed outcome to be built around it.  Sometimes dependencies come from the way the work is structured and sequenced and the way the teams are organized. For example, along the application tiers rather than around the functionality of the product. A few scaling frameworks exist that suggest ways of dealing with those dependencies. Be wary of frameworks that suggest managing dependencies. What they offer is to keep the status quo, regardless of its origin and meaning intact

Partially that is because the client lacks the clear understanding of the goal (sensory acuity), partly because the argument “you cannot measure what you do not have” (which is a fallacy), and partly, because other conditions of the well-formedness of the outcome are not met.  For coaching, an easy way to begin figuring out the complicated question of measurements might be to start with what the client measures right now. However, the bigger question is how current measurements, or the system of measurements is serving the client. It always behooves you to keep in mind the Goodhart’s law,16 “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”  Imagine the organization wants to increase its profit margins, which can be achieved in a multitude of ways. The company, for example, might consider raising prices targeting the top line, or cut expenses, affecting the bottom line. They need to be mindful of unintended consequences that will almost inevitably raise their collective ugly head.  Raising the prices without consideration of the market conditions might lead to customer dissatisfaction and market share loss. Cutting cost is often fraught with either cutting too much or cutting where it hurts which might shift people's attention away from the goal of increasing margin and lead to a cycle of perverse incentives and motivations.

Focusing your measurements narrowly and depriving people of the ways to see the bigger picture in which this motivation and its consequences play out, might result in effects that are opposite to those the company is seeking in the first place.  Well-Formed outcomes address this challenge through its condition of “Preserving Existing Benefits.” While developing outcomes, discuss with the client the things that are working well now that they don’t want to lose by achieving the new outcomes. The client needs to measure the aspects that will tell them they are achieving the desired results and they need to ensure that they are not losing the existing benefits they have when starting. If the outcome is stated in a way that, if achieved, endangers existing benefits, another revision is needed. They may also need to include preserving certain benefits into the measures of success so they can be monitored alongside other data.  In the case presented above, where the company had a very narrowly focused outcome of increasing its profit margins. If this narrow profit margin creates conditions that will endanger existing conditions the client wants to preserve, they may want to broaden the outcome.  It is likely that the real outcome the client is trying to achieve is ensuring company viability during the stormy market times. Increasing profit margin is just one solution to this broader outcome. By making the outcome broader, it provides space for multiple viable solutions to arise which can be evaluated for preserving existing benefits before committing to them. Measuring Outcomes There are a few comprehensive approaches to measuring the outcomes. While these approaches have books dedicated to describing their purposes and uses, two are worth mentioning here. The first approach is OKRs – Objectives and Key Results. This method is attributed to Andy Grove of Intel as the creator and was popularized by John Doerr in his book “Measure What Matters17”. This method is often used poorly and even abused when not clearly understood so we recommend that you read more about them and clearly understand them before simply jumping in with the client. When used well, this method can be very effective. Another approach pioneered by Scrum.org is Evidence Based Management (EBM) that was fashioned by Ken Schwaber after the evidence-based medicine that is used widely by healthcare professionals.  Regardless of which approach your client chooses to employ, you will serve them well by encouraging them to continuously inspect and adapt the measurement system they decide to put in place. Measures should not be set in stone, and they should not be so fluid as to render any measurable observations and resulting data meaningless. The client will be served well by striking the balance between having a few well-defined measures they want to keep an eye on, and the flexibility of their mindset with an understanding that as they progress towards the set goal, they should be willing (and able) to inspect the existing measures and maybe adopt new ones as they become available.  Condition #8 Ecologically Sound  To relieve your mind, let's start with clarity that ecologically sound is not referring to things like climate change.  In well-formed outcomes, ecologically sound means that you help the client to zoom out and take the 30,000 feet view to inspect how it will be affected by the desired outcome. In doing this you  17   https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221

help them take a wider system view through the lens of success to understand the ripple effects achieving the desired outcome will have in the full ecology of the system. (Or in the case of an individual, their lives.)  Think about it as checking for the unintended consequences. Unintended consequences can behave much like a body of water does when a boat passes through. Sometimes the boat glides over the water and creates small ripples that wander up to the shoreline. Other times the boat creates a wake that can overturn other boats and flood the shoreline. Unintended consequences aren’t inherently bad. Sometimes they are good and positive and reinforce the determination to implement the outcome. Sometimes they are just consequences where the client stays neutral to their existence and just notices them and moves on. And sometimes these consequences might be negative. Identifying these negative consequences when creating outcomes enables you to adjust and avoid them.  Alex shares, “I heard a fascinating story from the old days of Hewlett Packard, when that great company still bore the names of its founders and cared more about its innovation and world impact than its shareholders and the bottom line. Every day, mid-morning a coffee cart was driven through the office space. All the engineers stopped their work and came to grab some coffee. Then one of the costs cutting initiatives hit and the coffee carts were eliminated. The spirit of innovation in the company has never been the same again. Of course, it is a stretch to claim that Hewlett Packard became less innovative and more boring a corporation just because the coffee carts disappeared. However, what the decision makers did not take into the account was that the coffee breaks were opportunities for the engineers to get together, discuss, share, and debate the innovative ideas that propelled the company forward. With coffee carts these important informal opportunities that spread innovation were gone and the spirit was lost.”  When implementing a major (or minor) change you will frequently be hyper focused on the change itself and on the future state desired. What is usually missing is a different point of view that can be brought about by a single question, “How does the current state serve us?” There is almost a knee jerk reaction to answer that it does not. Are you crazy? It is horrible, that is why we are implementing these changes. But if you help your clients overcome this first knee jerk reaction, slow down and think, they will realize that there are positive sides to the current state, policy, process, or way of doing business. Remember that people always do their best with the resources and knowledge they have available. Those who designed the current state were not evil or ignorant. They likely had noble goals and outcomes in mind. What will not serve your clients best is throwing out all the present state and replacing it with something completely new. Waterfall is not evil, it worked for the companies and organizations for decades, maybe not as optimally and effectively as it could have, but it worked. What you can do is help your clients see all the facets of the current state – good and bad and choose what they want to leave behind, what they want to change, and what they want to preserve.  By ensuring that you have checked all nooks and crannies and haven’t left any stone unturned in search of the positive benefits of the current state you will improve the stickiness of the change to be implemented and take another step to make it effective, well-serving, and sustainable. Having a well-formed outcome that is clear, specific, and understood by the client is a key to their success. They should have a clear understanding of what they want to achieve before they start doing anything about it. This will help them stay focused and prevent any distractions that may lead to poor outcomes; it will also provide them with an overarching goal that can be used to validate tactical

decisions they need to be making along the way. Now, you are equipped with tools and understanding to help your client to define these well-formed outcomes and thus help them move forward towards their better future. 
Chapter 12: Coaching Organizational Systems  Cherie and Alex’s work at Tandem Coaching Academy has incorporated a learning path for Coaching Human Systems that focuses on organizational and team coaching because we know that coaching teams and organizations can be tricky work. This chapter introduces seven concepts we teach regarding how to shift from individual coaching to coaching a system using professional coaching competencies for multi-person clients and utilizing systems thinking as a foundational skill when coaching teams and organizations.    Scaling the coaching agreement  When working with organizations and teams, you will need to have multi-level coaching agreements. The most familiar agreement is the team agreement, where the team determines how they will work together. In the Agile space this is generally referred to as the team’s working agreement. You will likely use coaching to facilitate the development of this agreement for the team, however it is not actually a coaching agreement. The coaching agreement comes in when you shift from how the team will work with one another to how they will work with you. The coaching agreement focuses on how you and the client, team in this case, will work together and the outcomes you will focus on achieving.   You may have multiple coaching relationships in an organizational setting, so it is important that you have a coaching agreement with each client, whether individual, group, or team. Though you may have separate coaching relationships with individuals, when coaching the team, the team itself as an intact entity (system), not the individuals, is the client. The level at which you are working in the organization will determine the highest-level system for the purposes of your coaching agreements. You might consider this top-level coaching agreement an engagement agreement or engagement plan where you highlight the organizational business outcomes you will be working with the client to achieve.   Think of it this way, if you are working with a large company that has multiple divisions, departments, and teams of managers and staff you are working with a large system (the company) and its varying subsystems (each grouping below). Some of the systems are persistent, such as departments, management teams, etc. and others are transient such as a group of people in a meeting or training class.   If you are an enterprise coach, you should have a coaching agreement with the highest level of the organization you are contracted to work with. For example, if you are engaged to work with a portfolio, and are working with the leaders there you should have a coaching agreement that outlines the business outcomes you are working towards as an organization which will guide the

97 
work done at the descending levels. The leaders at that level will be the ones you make the agreement with, and the agreement really covers the work you will be doing with the portfolio as one entire system. The everyday work you do will be with subsystems like programs, teams, groups, and individuals who work in that portfolio.  Being clear on the coaching agreement up front including what you are focusing on, how you will measure success at the portfolio level will set the scope and focus of your engagement. It will also make expectations clear for what is expected of you and of the client. Having this agreement in place will set the stage for a stronger relationship and increase the likelihood of a successful engagement from the perspective that if you don’t know where you’re going, you’ll never know when you get there. Alex always says, “Strong contracts are the basis for strong working relationships. How we work together is clearly defined and we know how we will handle things when problems arise. With that out of the way, we can trust each other and put all our energy in collaborating and focusing on the work at hand.”    We’ve spent a lot of time in this book focusing on defining goals and outcomes because this is quite possibly the most important part of the work you will do as an agile coach. Clients, whether individual or organizational, will have an idea of why they want to engage a coach but generally haven’t thought through the outcomes they want in enough detail to clearly define them. Coaching your client through this is the beginning of the engagement process. Without the top-level engagement agreement in place, the value you are adding as a coach will not be clear to you or to the client.   What we’ve given in the last few chapters are multiple tools and models you can use to develop strong coaching relationships with your clients. They aren’t intended to be a checkbox process or method that you implement one after the other. You will more likely be utilizing the STORMMES © model to make sure that you have covered the essential elements while you are working with the client to define the engagement before and after you sign the contract.   You will likely use impact mapping once you get started to get a clear picture of what the client wants to happen once you figure out what the goals are. Well-formed outcomes help you define how you will know you’ve gotten where you want to be. The output of the coaching agreements will look different at every level you work with. You will have to develop your own methods of working with clients and the tools and models we’ve provided here can help you with that.   Cherie explains, “There was a point in my journey as an agile coach when I noticed that coaches and clients were pretty far out of sync. Coaches basically had the perspective that ‘we are agile, we are not going to document a plan for clients.’ I’m not certain if the thinking was that they were holding the Agile value of responding to change over following a plan, or if they really didn’t understand that the client saying they have no idea what the Agile coach is doing is an indicator that their engagement is in jeopardy. I think that this perspective of ‘we can’t give you a coaching plan’ is shortsighted and, quite frankly, wrong. If you don’t know where you are going, how will you know you’re going in the right direction? Leaders of organizations are right to be concerned if they are paying astronomical rates to have you in their company and they can’t

identify what it is that you are doing. When I ran coaching organizations, I taught (and required) the coaches to work with their organizations to develop engagement plans. Once these plans were in place, the client was clearer on what and why the coach was there and what outcomes they were both working towards. This immediately reduced the tension between the client and their budget concerns. It also gave the coach and client something to have an ongoing conversation about to review progress over time and to inspect and adapt as needed.   Cherie has a process that she uses which fits nicely after when she would be utilizing the STORMMES © model to have a high-level overview of what the engagement is intended to produce. Before mapping out goals using the impact mapping technique, the goals need to be defined. Cherie uses a process of “system entry” that serves several purposes. First, it enables her to make a personal connection with many individuals and listen to what they believe the challenges in the organization are. This is the first step in building healthy client relationships and developing trust and safety between her and the members of the organization. Second, it gives her the ability to hear how the system views itself so she can reflect it back to the system and find out if there’s alignment. Third, it enables her to hear how the client believes it should best solve its own challenges. All this information is utilized to build the engagement plan. Here is a high-level overview of her process.   Step 1: Get alignment with the top leaders (she includes this in her SOW) that you will start the engagement by conducting an engagement survey and that they are responsible for communicating this to the organization.  Step 2: Set up time to have conversations with people from every role and every level of the organization and organizations that directly impact the work they are doing. Cherie meets with the highest leaders one on one. Senior leaders one on one or in sets of 2-3. Line managers in groups of 2-3. She meets with a sampling of whole teams and small groups of 4-5 of each role. She generally sets aside the first week or two to conduct these conversations. She gets the list of who she will be speaking to from the organizational leaders, or the individual assigned as her change partner. The people she will be talking with get an introduction email from the leader explaining who she is and why she will be talking with them.   Step 3: Have the conversations. Keep in mind, this survey is not an assessment of the organization. The intent is not for the coach to figure out what’s broken and tell the client how to fix it. The intent is to hear the system describe what is working and not working and what they view as the most important things to improve. After talking to just a few people, themes start to arise. Most organizations have roughly 3-7 prominent themes that come from the conversations. To get the most valid information, everyone should understand that discussions are confidential and only themes will be disclosed. No actual comments or things individuals or teams say will be included in the output of the survey.  Step 4: Document the most prominent themes that arise from the conversations. Cherie uses a process of identifying each of them with a high level “current state” and “desired state” description. The desired state is a combination of what the client has said they want and what 

---

## Page 99

 
99 
your expertise tells you the desired state should be. These are not detailed and are generally 3-5 sentences long and fit on one PowerPoint slide for each theme. It’s enough to have a conversation about where they are and where they would like to be.   Step 5: Review themes with the top-level leaders to confirm that they are in alignment with what the rest of the system has described. Since you are simply reflecting what they told you back to them, there is rarely a case where the leaders do not agree with the themes that have risen to the surface. At this stage the leaders need to decide if they want to focus on all the themes that have arisen or if there are some that they want to make the business decision to set aside for now. There should be a discussion around how these themes tie back to business outcomes and what impact to business outcomes they expect if these themes are resolved. In essence, what will be the return on investment if they adopt these themes into the engagement plan that the organization will be focusing on for the next year (or other specified timebox)? There should also be a discussion about the priority order of the goals. Which goals will be focused on first and which ones fall to the bottom of the list of priorities if we can’t make progress on all of them?  Step 6: Once the desired state, return on investment, and priority of the goals is determined, the next step is to identify how success will be measured for each theme. How will you and the organization identify that the desired state has been achieved? (The well-formed outcomes process can help with this.)   Step 7: Identify potential coaching activities that will be done to help the organization meet the goals. These potential coaching activities are a blend of what the client said they needed during the survey. This often includes things like training and role definition. It is important for you and the client to understand that this is not a step-by-step list of all the things you will be doing. It’s more of a high-level view of what some of the work might be. You won’t know exactly what to do until you start working more closely with the organization. However, this part helps the leaders to have insight into what the coach is working on while they are getting paid to “walk around talking to people.”   This simple, high-level plan serves as the coaching agreement. It’s five components give you and the client clarity into what you are focusing on together, and clear measurements to look at when you check in on progress. A good cadence to have an inspect and adapt session with the leaders on progress is quarterly. It gives enough time to make some progress between check-ins while happening often enough to shift direction without losing much time. During these inspect and adapt sessions, the leaders may say to continue moving forward as previously contracted. They may decide that enough progress has been made on a theme that even though all the measures of success are not fully realized, the return on investment is sufficient to shift focus to another goal. They may also decide that the needs of the organization have shifted, and they want to eliminate some goals and add others.   This same process can be followed on a lighter scale with teams. Identify what they want to focus on over the next quarter (for example: speed of delivery), determine what current and end state are. Determine how this will tie to the larger organizational themes and business

outcomes. Determine what will be measured to show progress and achievement of the end state. Discuss a few things you might do over the next quarter to reach the goals outlined in the plan. How or if the coaching plan is documented is a decision between you and the team.   These conversations take time and effort, and they are the backbone of your coaching engagement. Without a good coaching agreement, the coach may end up trying to drive because the client hasn’t been clear about where to go. If you want the client to own making their own changes rather than looking to you to do the work for them, a coaching plan is the first step in making that happen.  Coaching organizations is complex work. Professional coaching skills and competencies combined with systems thinking can play a strong role in your success as an agile coach. During the rest of this chapter, the description “team” should be understood as any system within the organization you happen to be working with. These might be leadership teams, groups of product owners, scrum teams, etc.   Developing trust and safety  The coach must help the team members cultivate trust within the team, so they are safe to speak up, disagree, and surface challenges. It is essential to develop trust with each team member and the team as an entire unit, so the team feels safe working with the coach to change and improve.  Part of the work of cultivating trust and safety with individuals and groups is taking a non-judgmental stance. Teams and organizations are filled with amazing people who are very different and contribute different talents, approaches, and viewpoints. The differences in people do not make one better or worse than others, those differences are unique to each individual and each adds dimension to the system. Your role is to help the team see how these differences add to the strength of the team. Help them integrate the differences into the way the team functions. Helping teams to learn to have healthy conflict, to be okay disagreeing, and free to respectfully contribute ideas builds trust and safety on the team. Showing them that you are non-judgmental and don’t show partiality to any of the people, ideas, or contributions is important to building trust between them as a system and you as their coach.   Although you may be tempted, remember that it is not your role to determine what decisions, responses, actions, verbalizations, or inactions are good or bad. In fact, good or bad are very unclear terms that will mean something different to each person - and it’s a judgment. What’s more important than deciding if an interaction is good or bad is simply knowing if it is helpful or unhelpful for this group of people at this moment. Only the team can decide that. You might have an intuition of whether something happening in the team is putting them in a productive or non-productive state but only they can determine that for sure. Staying non-judgmental helps you to see that the different communications are simply information flowing through the system. This is information that the system needs to operate. Your role is to encourage the exchange of

information and reflect to the system what you see surfacing. Let them decide what to do with that information as their awareness of it becomes clearer.  Building resonance can also increase trust with you and the team. Resonance is a felt sense of connection between individuals' experiences and emotions resulting in deeper mutual understanding.  For example, you tell me about an experience you had. I had a similar, yet different experience so I make a mental and likely emotional connection with what you said. It resonates with me. Our stories have very real yet separate meanings for each of us, but they create a shared connection between us. Resonance between people is built by creating bonds through the telling of individual stories and sharing experiences. The choice of how much to reveal must reside with the individuals. Trust increases with each disclosure. As trust builds each small risk-taking action creates stronger links. The greater risk-taking happens as resonance increases. This is true between the coach and the system and with the members of the system. Trust on the team must be cultivated as well as trust between the team and coach.  System coaching presence   Having system coaching presence means that the coach must exercise presence, not with the individuals but with the group. This is another area where systems thinking is important.   Taking a step back to look at teams and help them look at themselves as a coherent system, rather than a collection of individuals and a bunch of cause-effect phenomena can have huge implications for the team dynamics. If they can see themselves as a single functioning system and realize that each team member serves a valuable function, they can begin to understand the role each one plays in the success (or failure) of the team. For example, instead of getting frustrated with that member of the team who seems to have a negative perspective, they can begin to appreciate the function that person serves in helping the team make well thought out decisions. Without this person focusing on risks the team might end up making big mistakes that can be avoided with a bit of critical thinking. They might also realize that the person who seems to be direct and outspoken or even disagreeable is serving a much-needed purpose on the team. They are the person who brings new perspectives and teaches the team to have robust discussions about multiple options before settling on the first idea to come forward. Each person brings something to the team that the team needs to function at its best. When the team embraces system thinking, they can realize that together the system is a much stronger unit than just the sum of its parts.    System thinking also impacts the way we approach coaching. When you take a system perspective, you will recognize that the team’s interactions aren’t just a series of cause-effect mechanisms. Systems are way more complicated than a string of single cause-effect actions and responses.   It may be tempting to look at the team and see simple cause-effect feedback loops happening. However, the cause-effect thinking style is narrow by design, “I do something, causing something else to happen/change/occur.” While this approach works in a lot of cases, more

often, it does not. Knowledge workers rarely deal with simple or complicated systems (see Cynefin section) these days, they are mostly complex and/or chaotic.    When working with a system, we must realize that at any given moment there are multiple cause-effect loops happening and impacting one another. So, we cannot think of single cause-effect loops in isolation. Thinking of a desired effect in isolation can be a sign of shortsightedness, and in some cases a grave mistake.   By stepping back and taking a system perspective you can get a clearer view that things don’t happen by simple cause and effect; rather, the desired outcome in a complex system can be achieved in numerous ways they occur through pulling a variety of levers. In addition, almost none of those levers are digital (i.e., on/off) but rather analog (i.e., they have a range of impacts, from negligible to extreme). At the same time, it is always a mistake to think that a single lever affects a single desired outcome, and desired, variable in the complex system. The effects are often unpredictable (and overlooked) if observed through the cause-effect prism. This explains how decisions made in one part of an organization can have major consequences in other parts of the organization when there doesn’t seem to be an obvious connection.  The moment we accept the fact that the team is a complex system with a lot of levers can open our awareness to many more opportunities in our work with teams.  These levers can be used to launch, accelerate, slow down, or sustain a variety of feedback loops. By understanding them and even utilizing them, we gain more opportunities to affect team workings and dynamics in ways that were not possible with a cause-effect approach.  There is another huge implication for starting to look at the team workings as a system. Systems are non-human. While a system may be composed of humans, once they come together and form a system that system is no longer a collection of individual humans - it is a non-human entity: the system. What it means is that we are looking at feedback loops, stocks (stored, accumulated material and information), and flows of the system as something naturally occurring where we can push and pull some levers to modify the system’s state. The system is devoid of an actor – a person who pushes and pulls the levers. Of course, there are specific people who affect the state of the system, but the focus isn’t on them as humans, only as actors who affect the system functioning, one way or another. Thus, a person, or a group of people are never in the center of the system, never its focus. In system thinking, we focus on the system's parts and components, such as stock, flow, levers, etc. and not on the person, their actions, or even worse, their character.  And this is the key to understanding an important property of a system, its blamelessness. Yep, you read it right – the system is blameless, and making it non-anthropocentric, i.e., replacing a person in the center of the system with a bunch of system descriptors, helps us to get away from what haunts a lot of teams and human relationships – blame. Blame is unhelpful, unproductive, and toxic. Hence, accepting the system approach to team functioning and coaching we can make huge strides on driving out that toxin.

 Systemic active listening   The act of actively listening is not the same as utilizing active listening skills you may have learned in your last business class. It includes those, however that is only a very small portion of what it means to actively listen. Actively listening when coaching a system utilizes the competencies of active listening used in coaching individuals and modifies them to work with a multi-person client. Systemic listening requires that you focus on the system while cultivating all the voices of the system and drawing out marginalized voices whose opinions are not the popular collective opinion or that may hesitate to speak their thoughts out loud.   Teams and organizations are complex systems. Communication happens in the system in many ways and every communication has a meaning for the individuals and the group. Communication in the system may come, among other things, in the form of words, body language, sounds, emotions, behaviors, opinions, divergent ideas, and how the system’s components (generally people but might include other parts of the geography the system operates within) organize themselves. All the ways that a system interacts, or doesn’t interact, reveals information about the system. Your role as the coach is to make the system transparent to itself. This may mean that you are making observations about how the system is interacting. It might mean that you make observations about the way the team is not interacting. It might mean that you notice verbally how the team has organized itself into smaller subsystems. For example, by the way they gather in small groups by role to collaborate to make decisions or possibly by the way they organize their seating arrangements. Remember as you notice these things that there is nothing inherently wrong with any behaviors they display. Those behaviors are simply more information for the team to utilize to understand how it can best operate. The team will need to decide if what they are doing is useful or unuseful and make decisions to change accordingly.  When sharing observations and questions with the system, it is important to focus on the system as one unit. To do this, you will, for the most part, refrain from having individual conversations with members while working with the group. For example, if you are in a session with the team don’t have a conversation with one member while the others watch. Instead take what that member says and reflect to the team. Cherie calls this “speaking to the center.” If you can imagine that the system is a circle with all the members forming the boundary, you want to direct your questions and observations to the neutral center space rather than directing it to an individual. When you work with a system, you are working with the relationship that ties the system together to make it an intact system. So, speaking to the center places your questions and observations in the neutral space where any part of the system can respond, and they are more likely to respond to one another than to you.  Reflecting what one person says back to the center of the system might sound like, “What’s it like for the rest of you to hear that perspective?” or, “What are some other perspectives that haven't been heard yet?” or “How do you respond to this perspective?” or, “I’m noticing that

when person 1 and person 2 are discussing this issue, others seem to check out. What’s happening?”  Systems are interconnected and information flows through the system. This means that it is not uncommon for multiple people to be thinking the same thing. And for them to hesitate to say it out loud. Then, when one individual finally says what they are thinking, others in the group reveal that they were thinking or feeling the same. One way to look at this is to say that information that is flowing through the system belongs to the system and is revealing the system. When one person speaks, they make what the system is thinking or feeling transparent to the rest of the system.  The coach can help this process by reflecting to the system what they hear emerging in conversations and by putting non-verbal communications into words. Verbalize what you notice rather than just noticing. Cherie says, “Coaches often tell me that they noticed things happening in the system and just tucked it away in their mind. It is more powerful to say what you see, sense, and notice so the team will have new information to work with. When the system sees itself transparently, it learns more. When it learns more, it can become more effective.”    Evoking system awareness  Instead of getting caught up in problems and solutions, focus on the team interactions which hamper or enable effectiveness and performance. Maintain a system focus by bringing what is happening with one individual back to the group to work with.  When coaching individuals, the client focuses on the problem and the coach focuses on the client. The same is true when working with teams. Instead of the coach getting caught up in the problems and solutions, they are more effective if they focus on the team. Let the team focus on solving the problem. You focus on the interactions and collaboration happening in the team so they can work together more effectively. This enables the team to focus on solving the problem leveraging the improved communication and collaboration achieved through the coaching process.  One way the coach can maintain system focus is by bringing what’s happening with one individual back to the group. Phrases like, “To what extent does that resonate with the rest of you,” or, “It sounds like you are experiencing ‘x’. What are the rest of you experiencing?”   Another way the coach can help evoke awareness in the team is using metaphor. Metaphors are powerful for helping the team condense information. Condensing happens when one person realizes something and expresses it to the team using a metaphor. The metaphor resonates and the team starts to build on that idea. Through the metaphor, the group pools its thinking and new understanding emerges. You can solicit a metaphor from the team by simply asking them, “What does this remind you of?” or, “What’s the image that comes to mind that would describe 

---

105 
what’s happening right now?” If you hear a team member utilizing a metaphor you can pull on that metaphor and see if it resonates with the team. Often, by stepping outside of directly speaking about a problem the team can be more innovative and get past blocks by working with a metaphor and then bringing back what they learned to apply to the problem.  Keep in mind that the goal of coaching is always to evoke new awareness in the client. Getting that new awareness is what creates the new mindset. When the client has a new mindset, they can see broader and have new ways of solving problems. The more they learn, the more they grow and the higher performing they can become.   Facilitating system growth   Coaches can often help systems become more transparent to themselves and decide how they want to improve using assessments. The goal is not for the coach to grade the team on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory scale. Instead, it is a way for the team to generate new insights about itself. The team must assess itself. If the team is assessing itself in an area the coach has expertise in, like technical practices, it is helpful for the coach to do an independent assessment based upon their interactions and observations of the team.    Again, the coach’s assessment isn’t to show the team or the team’s manager what they are doing right or wrong or if they are performant or not performant. The goal is to have more data points for a learning conversation. This coach’s perspective should not override the team’s view of itself. The intent is not to prove that the coach is right, and the team is wrong. Instead, it should merely be a way to uncover new information and provide feedback about the team’s performance and interactions from the outside looking in.   It doesn’t do any good for the coach to tell the team that they are doing something wrong that the team isn’t ready to hear. It’s okay if the team rates itself higher than the coach does in a certain area. What’s not important is not who is right or wrong. What’s important is the discussion about the gap. When discussing the gap. They will sometimes explain what they see that caused them to rate themselves higher than you did. If you are humble and open to learn from the team, you’ll see that they are correct. If your position is different, share it with them. If they are ready to see your perspective, they can accept it. If not, that’s okay too. What’s important is that the team gets enough perspective to make decisions about what they will focus on improving until the next time they assess themselves.   It's not up to you to decide what the team should be focusing on or to determine the priority order of improvements. It is more important to have the team decide what they would like to focus on. If they focus on improving things, they are passionate about improving, the changes are more likely to stick. Sustainable change doesn’t happen by force. It happens by opting in.   You might also utilize other group behavioral assessments that focus on how individuals on the team tend to interact with others. Assessments like this that have a group component can be

powerful tools in the hands of the team to understand and leverage team dynamics in a stronger way. Alex and Cherie use a few different assessments when working with teams and organizations. They always utilize assessments that have a team profile component because they provide both individual and team-based data to work with. The team profile gives an insight into individual thinking styles and behavioral characteristics. It also asks important questions about how these individual characteristics fit into the team’s complex system with its collective thinking and behavioral profiles.   Team composite reports show aggregated data with no personally identifiable information that the coach can debrief during a team coaching session where everyone has their own profile handy, as well as a collective team profile. As when debriefing any assessment, a good place to start the coaching session is to ask a question, “What stands out for you in this team profile?” and follow the flow as answers from the team emerge. You usually don’t need a huge bank of questions to help the conversation flow. For example, if the team identifies one or more behavioral traits at their extreme, it might be useful to help them think about the implications these extremes might have on them and their desired outcomes.  Helping the team connect several traits into balancing or reinforcing feedback loops can open the conversation up to more complex and useful insights. Team composite reports can be used over time to identify potential improvements rather quickly. Help them, design a few small actions and to build accountability methods around those. From time to time they should inspect the outcomes of the actions, and help them decide what actions to take, and repeat the process.   The team profile becomes useful as an ongoing reference for the events that might be happening in teams’ daily interactions. It gives the team the ability to speak in a much richer way, with non-judgmental language. It helps them to quickly identify and verbalize challenges and conflicts by naming specific actions rather than making personal attacks on individuals.   The team has the data to help them connect actions to traits in the profile. For example, if someone believes that an individual is dominating the meetings, they might point out that the behavior in question is actually a characteristic of the team and inquire if it would be useful to balance the trait by letting others speak in turn.   Taking a system perspective  To work from a systems perspective, the coach must take a step back to identify all the systems represented. This perspective will reveal a slew of systems and subsystems such as the team, the organizations around the team, and other teams. This viewpoint helps the coach identify if occurrences are happening in isolation, if triggered by something in another part of the system, or if it is a systemic issue that is part of the culture and how the larger organization functions. Without this viewpoint, the coach might try to resolve problems inside the team with minuscule results because the root of the problem resides outside the team.

A system perspective will also enable you to help a client organization collaborate, communicate, and design processes. It will also enable you to see how other subsystems inside the team and organization interact and learn. Some standard subsystems found in organizations are circles of friends, role-based groupings, full-time employees, contract staff, legacy team members, new team members, etc. These subsystems are part of the larger whole, so those subsystems’ workings will have impacts elsewhere in the organization. For example, two team members are good friends and discuss work outside of the team space. When the team collaborates, the friends have pre-determined their position on the matter and present as a united front, disrupting the team’s ability to diverge and converge ideas. Because they have pre-determined their position, the friends may not be as open to new ideas or building upon new perspectives.   Finally, taking a system perspective can help you to identify when challenges or impediments that surface are isolated to an individual on the team, the team, or the system around the team. Isolated challenges can be approached at the point of the challenge. Systemic challenges need to be approached from a higher systemic level to make progress on resolving them.  Overall, while coaching teams and organizations can be tricky, by incorporating systems thinking and some adjustments to scale core competencies across multi-person systems, you will cross the first hurdles.

Chapter 13: Engagement Types  The success that many companies have with Agile can be enticing to senior executives who want to make their organizations more competitive. They're encouraged by stories of Agile teams who can deliver products quickly to market. Convinced Agile will affect the change they seek; they excitedly send a team off to Agile training in hopes that come Monday that team will start churning out the results they’ve heard Agile promises. However, what often happens is that the team returns to the office and attempts to implement changes to the way they work only to discover that they are blocked by the existing organizational processes, rules, structure, and culture. This is when they realize that change must happen outside the team level to make the desired impact. Oftentimes, companies find that the culture that has worked for them in the past is now in direct contrast to the Agile operating model of self-organizing teams and transparent workflows. What happens next is all too familiar. Frustration occurs. Unfortunately, because the system is so big it is hard to see that the root cause of the perceived failure is not the individual teams, it’s not the leaders, and it’s not Agile. The root cause is that the company is desiring to see changed results without the ability to make the changes necessary to experience those results. The problem is the existing culture that must change to release the ability for the entire organizational system to change. Installation, Adoption, or Transformation Cherie shares her perspective. “In my experience as an Agile coach, there is a lot of confusion about what companies actually want. The company isn’t sure, and the coach isn’t sure. Most of the frustrations I hear between Agile coaches and their clients are because there is a misunderstanding about the work the client is trying to accomplish.” Companies sometimes only want training and installation Scrum, Kanban, or some other process. Coaches want the clients to “go Agile” and are frustrated when the client isn’t willing to make changes above the team level. Other companies want to adopt Agile and target specific areas of the company like engineering and product development. They don’t have the control or influence beyond these two groups to make a full company transformation effort happen. Coaches get excited and work with the clients, but soon the changes are rubbing up against the barriers of departments outside of engineering and product and the coach gets frustrated because the client isn’t willing or able to make the wider sweeping changes necessary to be a completely Agile company. Although “transformation” is a big buzzword in the Agile community, very few companies are ready to make the investment in a full Agile transformation. The larger the company is, the less likely a full transformation effort will occur. The words Agile transformation are thrown around so loosely in the industry that there isn’t clarity on what the term means, much less the time and investment it takes to get there. In this section we hope to bring a bit of clarity for coaches to understand the real scope of work they

are doing with clients, so there can be alignment for the engagement. Understanding what the client really wants is the first step in ensuring that you are focusing on the right scope of work. Without this understanding and alignment, you may end up pushing change that the company isn’t ready to make which will frustrate your teams, the leadership, and you. Process Installation Engagements This is the point in the book where some people will roll their eyes and say, “No! That’s not valuable!” Let’s investigate that viewpoint for a few minutes. First, we acknowledge that what we want for our clients is full transformation because we know that Agile gets great results. We don’t go out recommending that a client simply install Scrum or Kanban and declare, “We’re Agile!” We also acknowledge that since we don’t hold the budget, we don’t dictate what clients decide to do with their company. And often, the person who contacts us for an engagement doesn’t hold the budget the size of what’s needed to do anything more than installation. The question to ask yourself isn’t about if it is wrong for the client to only do an installation. The real question to ask is, is this the kind of work you want to do? If you are willing to see the client as fully competent to make decisions for their business, it will be easier for you to come to terms with the fact that there are many reasons far beyond what you are able to see for why clients make the decisions they make. Trust them. Partner with them. Move at the pace that works best in their world. What are some indications that your client wants an installation only engagement? They are primarily focused on training and/or team startup. They only want a short-term engagement, 3-6 months. They only want you to focus on teams. Managers are not accessible or interested in making changes to the way the organization operates. They are not willing to hire and give authority over the product to the Product Owners. They aren’t willing to assign people 100% allocated to a single cross-functional team and put work on backlogs rather than moving people to work on projects. They are not willing to pass all work through the product backlog with the PO having authority over prioritization. Work is directed to the team by managers who override PO’s authority. Where coaches tend to get frustrated is when they want the client to go further on the journey than they are willing to go. Instead of being frustrated and pushing against the client’s resistance to going further, leverage the momentum you have and focus on making the most sustainable impact you can make during the time you are there.

Cherie worked with a small client who had received initial training in Scrum and wanted 160 hours of coaching over a four-month period to help Scrum masters understand their roles better. While she was there, she tested the system to see how much change it was willing to tolerate. Several of the Scrum masters wanted to learn and grow as much as possible, only two managers were interested in engaging, some team members wanted to make improvements, and a group of product owners wanted to learn as much as possible. Everyone was very clear that no major structural changes were going to be made in the organization or its operations. Rather than trying to push the organization into adopting changes they weren’t ready to adopt, Cherie embraced the constraints that were in place. She partnered with the people who did want what she had to offer to come up with a plan that would add the most value. They decided to do a series of workshops covering a backlog of things they wanted to learn and practice implementing. Product Owners focused on learning and implementing product management tools and techniques. Scrum Masters focused on coaching skills, facilitation, and various Agile topics. At the request of the development team members, Cherie scheduled her time in the office on days they held Scrum events, so she could attend them and give feedback on how they were collaborating. The two managers wanted coaching, so they had 1-1 coaching sessions weekly. She spent most of her time in training and mentoring mode in response to what the client wanted and the amount of time she had to add value to the organization. These types of engagements can be successful when you are willing to accept the constraints and focus on what can be done rather than what won’t be accomplished. Stop focusing on what you can’t do, or the client won’t do. Focus on what you can do with the time and momentum you have available to you. Not all process installation engagements are this simple. Sometimes the client is willing to pay you to be there infinitely, but they are only willing to allow changes to happen that don’t disrupt the status quo. These engagements are often a bit harder to recognize, especially when there’s a systemic issue that’s covering the truth about what the client wants to accomplish. One large Fortune 500 company Cherie worked with was roughly divided into multiple enterprises with divisions and departments. Departments had roughly 10 teams each. The division leader was an Agile fan, so he was driving Agile transformation from the top and had required all his departments to transition to Agile. When she interviewed the department leader, she was going to be working with he said all the right things. He was fully invested, had the budget to support the engagement, was willing to promote change from his level, would be available to me and make sure his managers were also. There was also a larger effort at the company level and Agile was being supported to be adopted across all the enterprises and there was even a Board of Directors initiative with a goal that was tied to the performance ratings of some leaders. [see metrics chapter for our thoughts on this strategy] This company gave all the indications that they wanted an Agile adoption. On the ground, it was a different story. Cherie worked with them for about a year and made tons of progress at the team level. Scrum Masters were solid in their roles. They had moved into test automation and built a CI/CD pipeline. Teams experimented and some chose Kanban, others

selected Scrum. They were delivering consistently and were influencing other areas with technology. Though scaling wasn’t needed in that organization because the teams all worked on separate products and had very few dependencies, at their request we set up quarterly planning events, so teams could demo the features built in the previous quarter and give visibility into what was coming up in the next quarter. Until this point all the technical progress being made in the department was in alignment with what the managers and department leader wanted. The biggest challenge the managers had to overcome early in the engagement was letting go of separate frontend and backend teams. They resolved their concerns about reporting structure and oversight by keeping matrixed reporting. So, they settled on cross-functional teams with team members reporting to the discipline manager. Not optimal — but it was working for them. The rest was accomplished without managers having to make changes they didn’t agree with. They were at the point where to have an Agile adoption, things would have to change at the next level and culture would be impacted.  It was about eight months into the engagement when they finally hired product owners. This is when it became clear that this engagement would never move beyond team level process installation. To move forward the management team would have to agree to change. The Scrum masters started pushing on managers to stop giving work directly to team members and to work with the product owner to get work prioritized into the product backlog. Managers didn’t want to let go of the control of what their people worked on. They agreed to. Then, when they wanted something different than the product owner, they told the team members to do the work. Since the team members reported to the discipline manager (thus, not optimal) they had to listen to the manager. In essence, the product owners had no ownership of the products. When Scrum masters continued to push on the managers about working through the product owners it became tense. Scrum masters started confronting cultural challenges that violated Agile values and principles and things got even more tense. Finally, the Scrum masters were told that they would be fired if they didn’t stop pushing because there was no intention to make the changes they were promoting.  Cherie followed her normal procedures for handling a client engagement that is stalled or has reached the limits of its tolerance for change. She met with the managers and department leader and discussed next steps. She explained that they were at a place where no further movement forward could be made without change at the management level. They said they still wanted her to stay on as a coach, and they would work on it. Thirty days later they met again to discuss the lack of progress. The department leader admitted that they would not make any further changes, but they were being forced by the division leader to have a coach. They asked Cherie to stay and to just keep working with Scrum masters and product owners. They were willing to pay her to stay another year. Since the client made it clear that they were happy with team level process installation and had no intention to move forward with Agile adoption, Cherie declined. She offered that when they were ready to move to the next level she would come back and work with them. But until then she would move on to another client.

Cherie says, “I have learned that trying to force an organization to move forward when they aren’t willing is a waste of my time and their money. It doesn’t matter what the original agreement was. Once an organization has reached its maximum tolerance for change, it’s time to back off and let the changes settle.” Process installation doesn’t move beyond the changes that can happen at the team level. As you can see from these two examples, there are varying degrees of process installation. In the last example the ceiling was at the level of management change. For other companies they don’t get nearly as far as the teams in this example because they have technology challenges that become blockers. It is also common that the client believes they want Agile adoption only to discover they aren’t willing to make the level of change necessary for Agile adoption. Therefore, it’s important to continue listening to the client and being aware that it is not only individuals that have varying degrees of change tolerance. Organizational systems also have varying degrees of change tolerance. Because it’s extremely hard to predict the level of change tolerance in an organization, you must keep the big picture in mind and how the whole system is working together. Every organization has a place where change will no longer be tolerated. When you’ve reached that limit, the work is done.  Prerequisites for Agile Adoption Agile adoption is much different from process installation. Agile adoption is culture transition work.  Agile is a system of values and principles that govern the way a company thinks about how they envision the products they design and deliver. It impacts the practices they use, their operating model, and the way they interact with the individuals who are employed there. It is a way of thinking, believing, reacting, acting, and collaborating. It is a shift in the distribution of power and a transition to what Scrum calls its three pillars: Transparency, Inspection, Adaptation. The Agile Manifesto is where Agile adoption begins. When companies want to adopt Agile, they must first understand what they are adopting and why. Agile is not a process. Starting Scrum is not the same as adopting Agile. Having Kanban teams is not adopting Agile. Using a workflow or lifecycle management tool is not adopting Agile. Implementing SAFe or some other scaling framework is not adopting Agile. It is not unusual to join an organization that says they are an Agile organization and have been “doing” Agile for months or years and yet, they don’t know about the Agile Manifesto values and principles. They are often doing Scrum or Kanban and don’t know about the Scrum Guide or Kanban Guide. These organizations are generally doing some level of process installation and are using the buzzwords “Agile transformation” or “Agile adoption” to describe it. Our position is that a company must know what they are adopting to do so. For a company to adopt Agile, they must first understand the Agile Manifesto. It says:

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools Working software over comprehensive documentation Customer collaboration over contract negotiation Responding to change over following a plan That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more. As an Agile coach engaging a client who is asking to adopt Agile, you must start here. What is the position of the leadership of the organization (not just a single leader, engineering manager, or hiring person) on these values? To find out, you must first understand systems thinking (see the chapter on systems thinking). Individual conversations cannot tell you how the leadership system thinks. To understand if the thinking of the leadership is in line with these values, you must view the system as one living entity. We recommend that coaches approach working with the leaders of the organization from the perspective that they are a human system. Before any Agile can be done, first the leaders need to determine what set of values and principles they will adopt and work within. The coaching work begins by helping the leaders decide if they will adopt these values into their ways of working, so the culture can be shifted. To adopt these values as an organization, first the leaders must be willing to adopt them. That individual adoption is a mindset shift that takes time, effort, and a true desire to change. Let’s look at each value a bit closer to understand what adopting them means. We value individuals and interactions over process and tools  If the leaders are focused on training, fixing the teams, or adopting a work management tool, they may not yet be ready to move forward with Agile adoption. Agile adoption goes beyond these things and creates a cultural change. To create culture change that reflects agility, first, they must choose to value the people who work in their organization and help those people have constructive interactions with each other and with the leadership. They must be willing to utilize processes and tools to assist individuals to have better interactions — not to determine how people work. Processes should be built to solve specific problems. They shouldn’t be rolled out as simple solutions to complex problems. Leaders must be ready to give up the perceived power that determining solutions, processes, and tools gives them. They must be willing to wait until challenges emerge and apply the right solution for that challenge instead of dictating blanket processes for everyone. This means that simply rolling out “best practices” to everyone doesn’t create value in an Agile culture. They must be flexible on process and allow problems to be solved at the point closest to the work.

Depending on how far from this value the leaders are, it will take time for them to change the way they think and interact. The big question that needs an answer before you get started is, “Do you really believe that people interacting and collaborating to design the right solutions is more valuable than using your current processes and tools to run your company?” If the leaders can explain why they agree that this is the best way to work and the kind of leader they want to be, then they are ready. If they can’t or argue against relinquishing power, they are probably more in alignment with a process installation. “Another way to test this value is to see if the company is willing to invest in people and in relationship quality,” says Michael. “Is there time for learning and collaboration? Or is delivery work the only type of work that is valued?”  We value working software over comprehensive documentation and customer collaboration over contract negotiation To adopt this value into the culture of the organization leaders must be ready to experiment, get feedback, and experiment some more. Their viewpoint on failure should be one that expects a feedback loop and embraces failures as ways to grow. Their focus shouldn’t be on the “one neck to choke” but on what they can learn and utilize as they move forward. Adopting this value means that they must be ready to be comfortable not knowing everything upfront. They must be okay with changes and experimentation. They must be willing to listen to what the customers need and adapt to those needs as they change. They must be ready to focus on the outcomes they want to achieve and the problems they want to solve rather than prescribing the solutions. They must be willing to focus on value delivery outcomes instead of day-to-day outputs of individual team members. These changes may move out further than just the department and impact other enterprise-wide processes. Are they ready to tackle collaborating with those organizations to figure out how they are going to operate differently and still serve the needs of both groups? If they can describe why they believe this is the right way to lead, they may be ready for Agile adoption. If not, they may not be ready to let go of the perceived control they have with other ways of working and move towards Agile adoption. We value Responding to change over following a plan If they are going to adopt this value, leaders must be ready to allow teams to determine how much work it will take to solve problems. This means that no one can pre-determine deadlines for delivery without first consulting the people doing the work. It also means that they must be flexible and realize that as new information emerges the scope of the work delivered during a release period may change from the original projection.   Are they ready to deal with not knowing all the answers upfront and making changes in scope and timeline as more is understood and based upon customer feedback to the work being

delivered? The leader’s ability to think differently about how the organization approaches work determines the organization's ability to adopt Agile values and principles. Agile Adoption Engagements Adopting Agile is more than just adopting new processes and procedures, it involves changing the way the culture of the company approaches the work. How open to experimentation is leadership? How do they react to perceived failure? Do they have a fixed mindset or a learning mindset? These are all critical questions and shifts that must be made for the organization to successfully adopt Agile. Agile adoption must happen at the organizational level, and it starts with the people who have the power to make change in the organization. They lead the way because they determine the culture of the organization. Adopting Agile will change everything. It’s a different way of thinking about how you run your business and do product development.  Agile adoption also has a ceiling where change stops and that generally falls just outside where the highest leader who wants adoption has control. They develop a beautiful ecosystem with a culture that honors Agile values and principles, and they are getting more of the business results they want. Then, at some point the blockers to progress occur outside the scope of control of that leader. For every company the boundary is different. It might be that the compensation and performance system of the company is forcing team members to be competitors instead of collaborators. They may want to change performance management so that it is team focused with an individual component instead of individual focused with a team component. If the highest leader doesn’t have the power, influence, or permission to make these changes, they are blocked. The company’s funding model is a common blocker. If the highest leader can’t get that to change it becomes a barrier to progress. With enough of these blockers, progress stalls, and it becomes clear that beyond this point, the wider organization does not have the tolerance level needed for the amount of change needed for a full Agile transformation. To do that, the leaders at the top of the enterprise must decide if Agile is the solution for the business problems they want to solve. They must decide if there’s enough return on investment to make changes throughout the entire company. Agreeing to Agile transformation means change on a larger scale and includes areas outside of product and engineering that impact their value delivery. Without that commitment from the very top level, it is not possible to have an Agile transformation.  Agile Transformation Engagements  Agile transformation requires the entire organizational system to change. It goes beyond practices and processes. It goes beyond adopting Agile values and principles and technical practices. True Agile transformation requires that everything about the way you do business changes. Hiring practices, compensation practices, performance management, organizational structure, the way you contract with clients and vendors, the physical set-up of the work

environment, sales and marketing, the way work is funded, and ownership and accountability for decisions.  It is moving from project management to product management and many other aspects of the way a company operates. Depending on the size and structure of the company, an enterprise might be a stand-alone part of the company who has power over all these aspects held within. Sometimes an enterprise is a portfolio or division. Other times it's the entire company. Therefore, people who are working as enterprise coaches need such a wide skill set, and they often need other coaches to partner with because no one can know everything. There is an abundance of coaches in the industry who are engaging with clients and calling the work they are doing Agile transformation. Oftentimes it’s not. It is often the case that an Agile coach says they are leading an enterprise Agile transformation, but they can’t get access beyond the first or second layer of management. This is an indication that the expectations and desires of the coach and the expectations of the company are out of alignment. If the top leaders are not involved, the company is not interested in a full Agile transformation. Usually, what’s happening is that the organization which may be only engineering and/or product want to adopt Agile. Many simply want an installation of Scrum or Kanban. Coaching an enterprise Agile transformation requires that the client and the coach are in alignment with the vision and direction they are going. It also requires that the coach understand more than how an enterprise should function in theory. The coach can be a much stronger partner if they have experience understanding the complexity of running enterprises and the complexity of introducing changes into large organizations. Understanding and experience in organizational change management, human change theory, conflict management, and other soft skills are often overlooked but very strong skills for an Agile coach to have. Working at the enterprise level also requires the ability to communicate with executives, appreciating the complexity of what they do and how hard leading a company is. The skills needed to do the transformation work for an entire company are immense. It usually takes a team of coaches. The coaching team helping the company evolve needs more than just Agile knowledge, technical expertise, and experience. To be well-rounded, the team needs skills and experience in areas like executive decision-making, performance management, hiring practices, termination and downsizing practices, making decisions about pay rates and bonus structures, vendor management and contracts, strategic planning, and organizational structure. It requires experience in change management and process improvement. It requires professional coaching skills, collaboration skills, conflict management, and negotiation skills. It requires strong facilitation and teaching skills and enough experience to give a professional opinion about which route might be the best direction to go next. But most of all, enterprise coaching requires humility and endurance. One of Cherie’s experiences with a client who wanted a full enterprise Agile transformation was with a midsize company that was growing through acquisitions. The founder and CEO of the company had a business problem to solve. They were growing at an exponential rate and could not keep up with the demand. They needed the ability to deliver faster, respond to customer needs, and scale their platforms to handle the capacity. Agile held solutions to many of his business problems, so he went all in and committed to a full Agile transformation. He

understood that it would likely be a multi-year effort, and they would never fully “arrive.” Continuous improvement would always be in their future. Another enterprise coach who was local to the company’s headquarters led the engagement and partnered with the company to make major changes over the first year before Cherie arrived to partner on the effort.  The level of buy-in and willingness to shift everything was amazing. They focused on the most critical problems and implemented changes to solve those problems. Then, they focused on the next most critical problems. They experimented and embraced failure. Power over product decisions and roadmaps was given to product owners. Organizational and reporting structures were shifted to have cross-functional teams fully dedicated to products all reporting to a single manager. Performance management, merit increases, and bonus structures were changed to be iterative and focused on team effectiveness with a component of individual performance. They experimented and developed creative ways to hire agilists, created job descriptions and pay structures in alignment with Agile roles. The work area for Agile teams was completely redesigned giving each team their own team rooms with everything they needed available. The space was large enough for them to have isolation when they needed to focus and the ability to collaborate with other team members as needed. They changed their contracts to Agile contracts and began to contract with their customers to have their own dedicated teams that focused fully on their product. There were no more projects and project funding. The funding model was changed to fund teams instead of projects and capitalization tracking was shifted to a higher level, so team members didn’t have to track every hour and spend time filling in timecards to bill it to some line item. Teams were given the power to make their own decisions about their work schedules and time off. Work wasn’t monitored by managers to make sure everyone put in 40 hours. Leadership focused on outcomes and the teams were responsible for delivering and trusted to manage their work accordingly. The changes listed here are just a small sample of the total transformation efforts the company committed to. There were many changes to culture and a focus on continuous improvement, a growth mindset, experimentation, and a commitment to living by Agile principles. They held hackathons, had communities of practice, and even set up an internal conference to share ideas across the company. Everyone had a budget for training and development and tuition reimbursement. Everyone in the organization had the ability to stand up and say, “I disagree.” Everything wasn’t perfect and improvements were still being made when the company was acquired by a larger Fortune 500 company. The CEO went on to take a seat at the acquiring company and was able to bring many of the same changes before leaving. Even with all this progress, the work was far from done at the larger company when Cherie left after four years.

Why culture matters The effectiveness of Agile's autonomous teams is like a siren song to company leadership, and it's easy to see why. Because you can improve performance by changing the operating model. Take this exercise that Michael uses during presentations to Agile practitioners. He says, “I divide them into two groups. I ask the first group to organize themselves by first name in alphabetical order. With the second group, I designate someone to be the manager to organize the team to accomplish the same task. None of the members of the second group are allowed to talk to each other. What is the outcome? You know the answer. The first group accomplishes the task much more quickly because they're self-organized, able to communicate with each other, and are empowered to make decisions. The second group must work through one person to get things done. The team is more hierarchical and bureaucratic, and hence, progress is slower. This exercise demonstrates some differences and simulates some effectiveness of working in an operating model with centralized decision-making vs an operating model with distributed decision-making. It sounds like a win for Agile, right? Self-organizing teams’ rule. But there's a catch. For all its wonderful practices, an Agile operating model will most likely fail if the company culture is in direct opposition to it. An organization’s culture is one of the leading impediments to adopting and scaling Agile, according to the 13th Annual State of Agile Report by VersionOne. It's one of the reasons it's so natural for Agile coaches to do culture and leadership work with an organization first before working on the operating model. We know that true Agile transformation can take place only when the culture supports it. Still, culture change is an evolutionary process. And company leaders may not be ready to dive into the culture conversation right away. Instead, they're looking for quick wins, such as improving deliverables to customers or running more effective meetings. We have seen plenty of companies optimize their operating models within an existing culture. Ultimately, though, culture is the key ingredient to a continuously successful operating model. Another benefit to changing the culture is you will have a wider range of operating models to choose from, models that can flex and bend as the economy expands and contracts, new competitors arrive at your doorstep, and technology introduces more efficiencies. Those operating models may draw from Agile and Scrum practices, or something else entirely. For example, Spotify began with an operating model based on Scrum and then evolved into an operating model involving squads, guilds, and chapters. What culture model do you have?

In his influential management book, Reinventing Organizations, author Frederic Laloux defines different versions of organizational culture and assigns each one a color. This model is one of several well-known and studied cultural models. The point is not to use one model or the other but to use the models that are most useful in a particular engagement. Here we use the Laloux model to illustrate this approach. We encourage you to substitute your preferred cultural model. In the interest of time, we are simplifying Laloux's findings into four categories to help you identify what type of culture model you have now and which one you aspire to have and encourage you to investigate these further in Laloux’s book: Red: A rules-based, bureaucratic culture.  This is the type of cultural model where you must follow the rules. If you break them, you get in trouble. Say you drive 30 mph in a 25-mph zone. It doesn't matter that it's just 5 mph faster than the speed limit. The cop will still give you a ticket for the infraction. Orange: A performance-based culture. In an orange culture, financial success is the goal. This is associated with hierarchical power and decision-making, although this practice is not seen in all orange cultures.  It's the world of more, in which orange companies want to get bigger and bigger. Green: A family-based culture. In this culture, organizations care about their people and treat them like family. It's not the opposite of orange, because companies with a green culture still want to make money, but profit is only one piece of the puzzle. Teal: A self-management, evolutionary-based culture. In a teal culture, everything is in harmony, balanced, and suited for a particular purpose. A good example of teal is the social intelligence of ants. If you step on an anthill, within a few hours, ants will reorganize and rebuild their home. This isn't to say that an organization is only one color and nothing else. Most companies must worry about the bottom line, after all. And they may switch cultures based on the situation. A green company may become red when sales go south. They might also switch cultures when a new leader with a different management style steps into the company. We are not saying that one culture is better than another. They all serve a purpose. For example, take a primarily red organization. When an earthquake happens and the building is shaking, you want leadership to tell you what to do and where the exits are. This isn't a situation where you ask someone how they feel about the earthquake before making a move. But in the world of problem-solving, the type of culture you work in will either restrict or enable your abilities. If you work in a red culture with rules and bureaucracy, your degrees of freedom are limited as is the set of operating models from which to choose. As the culture moves from orange to green to teal, the degrees of freedom expand, enabling more adaptability, diversity of opinions, greater collaboration, and innovation. So, as you look at each culture model, ask yourself three questions: 

---

## Page 121

 
121 
1. What culture am I in now? 2. What culture would I like to be in? 3. Do I want to take responsibility for changing the culture? Questions 1 and 2 are the easy part. If you're swimming against the tide at work, it probably won't surprise you that most of us live in an orange world. When I give presentations about this topic, most audience members identify as working in a red or orange environment. But they want to work in a green or teal environment. Question 3 is by far the harder question. So how do you make a difference? Baby steps to changing the culture Shifting the culture first requires looking inward. To a large degree, culture reflects our internal state of personal growth and awareness. It is how we show we care about other people, and how we show respect to others. If we change ourselves, we can eventually influence change in our sphere of influence.  One way to become familiar with incremental culture changes is to learn about David Marquet's Ladder of Leadership. A former U.S. Navy captain, Marquet introduced this new approach to culture when he was commander of a troubled nuclear submarine. Under his watch, the USS Santa Fe went from the worst-performing submarine in the fleet to the best. He turned the ship around by switching from a command-and-control culture to one that inspired the crew to assume responsibility for their actions. In his book, Turn the Ship Around, Marquet describes The Ladder of Leadership as having seven rungs, and each one pertains to the relationship a boss has with an employee or employees. The format for each level is the boss’s stance/employee’s stance. Either can be the initiator of the conversation. Level 1: Do this... / Tell me what to do... This is a standard, top-down, command-and-control model.  The boss tells you what task to do, you do the task, you tell them that you're done, and the boss gives you another task. On this rung of the ladder, the employee is not empowered to make independent decisions. They ask what to do. Level 2: What do you see?... / I see… In this situation, the boss seeks to expand his visibility into the organization. For example, say the boss has a 10-person team. Through inquiry, he goes from seeing not only what he can see but what 10 other people see. The organization has become more capable because it values the observations of others. On this rung of the ladder, the employee has the freedom to approach the boss with unsolicited information to influence decision-making. Level 3: What do you think?... / I think… Now the boss relies on more than observations and information. He asks his team what they think so that he is receiving input, opinions, and

122 
recommendations from others. On this rung of the ladder, the employee is encouraged to approach the boss with opinions and recommendations. Level 4: What would you like to do?... / I would like to do… In this situation, the boss asks his team members what they want to accomplish as individuals. This is in line with the boss making problems transparent and allowing the employee to determine options for how they want to solve them. On this rung of the ladder, the employee is encouraged to notice problems and approach the boss with suggestions for how the employee might solve them. Level 5: What do you intend to do?... / I intend to… Now the boss is looking for solutions that will benefit the whole. There is a presumption here that the employee does not need permission. The decision-making power has been given to the employee and the boss has shifted to a being informed stance. On this rung of the ladder, the employee assesses the problem, determines the best solution, and keeps the boss informed of the actions they will take. Level 6: What have you done?... / I have… In this case, the team has become more autonomous. They are still expected to keep the boss informed, but they are expected to make decisions and take actions without delay and inform the boss later. On this rung of the ladder, the employee is given the power to work more autonomously with the expectation that they regularly check in to keep the boss informed. Level 7: What have you been doing?... / I've been doing…At this level, employees are truly autonomous. They are identifying problems, making decisions, acting, and have ownership of the work they do. They check in with the boss occasionally, so the boss has visibility into progress. On this rung, the employee is fully accountable and responsible for their actions, decisions, and lack of action. The boss becomes an advisor. By using this Leadership Ladder, you can do three things to change the culture of your organization. Here's how: 1.  Observe your leadership style As you study your style of leadership, you'll see how it differs depending on whom you interact with. You may be a Level 1 with one person, a Level 4 with someone else, and still another level if you haven't gotten enough sleep. Over time, you'll notice patterns. 2. Observe other people's leadership styles Over time, the different leadership levels will become second nature to you. The next step, then, is to start noticing other people's leadership styles. Soon you'll be able to walk into a room and within 10 minutes identify everyone else's leadership style. This gives you a highly context-sensitive understanding of leadership styles. 3. Invite shifts in leadership styles

123 
The final step is to invite shifts in leadership. By influencing how leaders work with you, you encourage them to let go of control, trust others, and become more comfortable with autonomy. For example, if you have a boss who is a Level 1 and is telling you to do this or that task, you might respond by saying, "I would be happy to do that. Do you mind if I also tell you what I see?" Utilize Management 3.0's Delegation Poker18 as a coaching tool to help teams and leaders see their current level of delegation and where they might make potential shifts As you can imagine, this doesn't happen overnight. It's a process that takes time and commitment. But it's worth it. These types of interactions allow you to incrementally shift the leadership in your organization and by so doing, eventually, evolve the culture.  So, when people are sent off to weekend Scrum training, eventually, they'll return to a culture that is more in alignment with the changes they are being encouraged to make. As Michael Sahota so elegantly states, "Success with Agile requires us to focus on culture. There is no other way." If you approach an Agile evolution this way, you're more likely to pave the way for success. 
Chapter 15 - Coach Client Partnership Consulting vs. Coaching Perhaps the greatest difference between coaching and consulting is where the intellectual authority lies. Coaching is a partnership, with the coach and client collaborating primarily utilizing the client’s intellectual authority and experience to design new experiments, decisions, and ideas. With coaching, the client is the one with the answers. It’s not the coach’s job to provide advice and instruction, but to ask challenging questions, make observations, and open new perspectives, so the client can see options and formulate the best solutions for their environment. Coaches help clients take time to reflect, learn and develop new ways of thinking. With consulting, the intellectual authority is typically in the hands of the consultant. Clients turn to consultants for advice, instructions, and professional opinions because the consultant can provide answers in areas where the client doesn’t have the experience or expertise. Consultants often step in and do work for the clients. Helping clients learn may involve tapping into your own experience and expertise in each area, but you never want to simply hand over the answers and dictate action. You also want to be careful about combining coaching with consulting or mentoring, as switching between stances can be difficult. Unless the client really understands and has experienced professional coaching from a trained and qualified coach, they may not understand what the distinctions are between the two. Many people instinctively believe that a professional coach is like the personas of sports coaches who call the shots and tell players which actions to take and how to improve. Sport coaches sit in a place of authority over players and can dismiss them from the team or bench them at any time. So, players don’t have much leeway in refusing to do what the coach tells them. If you do coach this way, clients can become dependent on you and look forward to you telling them what to do.  18  https://management30.com/practice/delegation-poker/

This places the responsibility for success or failure on you. In such cases, you’re no longer a coach, but a consultant. You surely agree that a coach and a car mechanic have two different jobs. But that doesn’t stop clients from frequently expecting the same type of service from their coach as they get from their mechanic. No, they’re not expecting us to change their vehicle’s spark plugs or work on the brakes. But they often want the same kind of easy drop-off service that mechanics provide. Just bring your organization in, drop it off, and then come pick it up when everything is fixed. That is not how sustainable organizational coaching works. Instead of leaving the scene to let the coach do all the work, the client and coach form a partnership to get the job done. This chapter explains what partnering is all about. The concepts in this chapter will help you to understand how an Agile coach can operate as an enterprise coach working from a coaching stance. We draw on ICF Core Competencies and discuss how these competencies look in practical application. Keep in mind as you read this chapter that the client could be a single person, a group of people, or even an entire organizational system.   Client Anti-Disempowerment Even if the client understands what coaching is and a coaching agreement in place, they may fall into one of the most common traps. That trap is shifting the power to the coach. When this happens, you want to practice client anti-disempowerment. The term can be best understood by breaking it down: Empowerment: Authority or power given to an individual to do something. You don’t need to empower the client. The client is already empowered. They have the authority and power to make decisions and changes in their environment. Disempowerment: The removal of the authority or power of an individual to do something. Clients may attempt to disempower themselves by transferring authority or power over to the coach. This happens when clients want or expect the coach to fix their organization for them. Anti-disempowerment: Counteracting the client's attempt to shift the power and authority from themselves to the coach. Client disempowerment tends to occur when the client doesn’t want to, doesn’t know how to, or doesn’t have time to do the work. They may be passionate about reaching their goals and improving their operations, but they believe that making the changes is something they can delegate to the coach. They see the work as simply determining processes and pushing them out. Another, often subconscious, reason a client disempowers themselves is to remove themselves from the equation if things go wrong. If the plan blows up, they aren’t responsible. At the same time, they can re-insert themselves into the equation if things go right. If the plan creates exceptional results, they can take credit for the success. This doesn’t happen because the client is irresponsible or greedy for promotion. More often, it’s a symptom of the environment. If there is a culture that responds to failure with punitive measures, fear runs rampant. To deflect punitive repercussions for failure, people deflect responsibility. If the culture is a command-and-control type environment where decisions get overridden and people are expected to just follow directions, the client will follow the cultural norms and expect to be told what to do.

Sometimes, the client attempts to shift responsibility for the change onto the coach because, while they want change, they don’t have time to focus on changing. If that’s the case, then they need to give power to someone in their organization to own and make changes on their behalf. The executive needs to specify who is authorized to make changes, determine goals, and take responsibility. Cherie says, “I won’t accept an engagement where I do not have an individual or team of people who will be leading the change effort and have authority, decision-making power, and organizational influence to get the job done.”  If potential clients insist, they want the coach to fix the problems for them and take responsibility for the changes, that client may be better off with a consultant instead of a coach. What Partnering Means For our purposes, partnering refers to collaboration where both coach and client are equally invested in the outcome. That doesn’t mean; however, each party holds the same responsibilities or performs the same amount or type of work. The coach helps the client discover options, brainstorm ideas, and gather motivation. They challenge the client’s way of thinking and give useful feedback, but they don’t have authority over the client, their decisions, or actions. The client decides the focal point of the work and makes the decisions. They determine where they focus next and how they will measure success. They partner to think through strategizing and problem-solving. However, the client makes the decisions and owns the solutions, next steps, and experiments. The client must take ownership of their change. If the coach is the forcing mechanism for the client’s change, then long term success is dependent on the coach’s presence. If the coach leaves, the client’s changes are likely to roll back. Michael says, “Let’s say the client and coach are in a car heading to the mall. Both know where the mall is. The client is driving; the coach is navigating. The client gets to choose if they turn left, turn right, go in reverse, or even drive in circles. The coach helps increase awareness of options, but not to make the decisions on the route they’re going to take. The mall is the business goal. The car is Agile. The driver is the client, the decision-maker. The navigator is the coach, open for co-brainstorming and sharing experiences and what they see in the client. Clients are free to drive as far and wide in any direction as they wish if they believe it will get them to the goal. This is much more effective than the coach taking the wheel. The clients are the ones who know what works or doesn’t work within their organization. And the client has the authority to make changes in the organization, unlike the coach.” Every company is different. It’s not the coach’s responsibility to know how the company operates, or to dictate the path they must follow. The coach can, however, work with the client to shine a light on areas of the company that will benefit from change. This concept can be understood more clearly with another metaphor. Cherie says, “Two people are walking side-by-side exploring a cave. One person has a flashlight; the other does not. The coach is the one holding the flashlight, and the first question to the client is: “Where do you want to explore?” The client is choosing the way. They are the decision-maker that selects the direction to move through the cave. The coach is helping the client increase their understanding of the different paths that are available by shining the light on them, so the client can see them more clearly.

The client decides which paths they want to explore, and which are not useful. Along the way, the coach shines the light on stumbling blocks and dangerous cliffs, so the client can respond and mitigate the risk of injury. If the client decides to climb down a dangerous cliff, the coach shines the light to make sure they see all the possible pathways and impediments. They discuss the plan for getting down safely and the coach accompanies the client in the endeavor, keeping the light shining as they adjust the plan along the way. The paths increase agility which, in turn, helps achieve the overall business goals. The cave is the organizational and business environment, which includes the company’s culture, operating model, and business model. The flashlight is the coaching conversation, shining awareness and providing options, perspectives, experience, and tools. It can bring issues or options to light that the client never even realized existed. Coaching Competency — Partnership According to the ICF, when a coach is competently partnering with clients, these things will be apparent when setting up and working throughout the engagement, The coach partners with the client and relevant stakeholders to establish an overall coaching plan and goals, Partners with the client to determine client-coach compatibility, Partners with the client to identify or reconfirm what they want to accomplish in the engagement, Partners with the client to define what the client believes they need to address or resolve to achieve what they want to accomplish in the engagement,  Partners with the client to define or reconfirm measures of success for what the client wants to accomplish in the coaching engagement,  Partners with the client to manage the time and focus of the engagement Continues coaching in the direction of the client’s desired outcome unless the client indicates otherwise, Partners with the client to end the coaching relationship in a way that honors the experience. Similarly, ICF expects competent coaches to maintain a relationship of mutual respect and trust with the client. They will also partner with clients to create a safe, supportive environment that allows the client to share freely. Some of the things that will be apparent in the engagement if the coach is competent are, The coach seeks to understand the client and client system within their context, which may include their identity, environment, experiences, values, and beliefs, Demonstrates respect for the client and client system’s identity, perceptions, style, and language and adapts one’s coaching to the client,  Acknowledges and respects the client and client system’s unique talents, insights, and work in the coaching process.

These three indicators focus on seeing and embracing the client for who they are and where they are at this moment in time. Whether the client is an individual in the organization or the organizational system, you need to be able to step into their shoes and have some empathy for what it is like for them to live in their world. One reason many coaches pick a niche in a particular field is that it is easier to work with clients when you understand their world. As an Agile coach, you understand Agile and how it works. The question is, “Do you understand what it’s like to be your client working in the midst of this change in their imperfect world?” It is important for the coach to be able to develop the empathy to recognize what challenges the client faces. We will not always have the full context to understand the client’s world and the politics and systemic issues that are holding them back. In these moments, we must draw on our empathy and listen to the client. Look beyond the story. Imagine how it must be to live with the unique challenges of their environment. The coach’s responsibility is to take the steps necessary to gain whatever context is needed to meet the client in their world. You don’t have to understand the details of their technical systems and processes, but you do need to understand their culture and how the system functions. You need to understand what it’s like to be in an organization going through massive change that is often out of your control. You need to understand the stress that executives and managers face and recognize that Agile is not their whole job. Coaches must be careful to not dismiss the client’s perspectives because they see things differently. Everyone has different experiences and will often have a view of the world that is unlike that of the coach/Agile coach. Just because your client comes from a command-and-control or waterfall background does not mean that they don’t know what they are doing. Don’t dismiss their experience or discount it because it doesn’t mirror yours. Technology has enabled companies to search out and employ the best talent around the world. This means that you will work with individual clients inside of organizations who have different cultures and backgrounds. As a coach who works with a large variety of people, it is your responsibility to be educated about the context of how your clients experience everyday life. When working internationally, you also must be aware of how people experience the world in their respective countries. You must be open to understanding their world and respecting their viewpoints. You must hold the context in which they experience life as valid, even when it is different from your own. In short, you must remain curious. Curiosity helps you understand the progress the client is making and the courage they must exercise to make individual decisions and changes. Being genuinely interested enables you to have some understanding and empathy. However, you need to make sure that you do not convert that empathy to sympathy because sympathy assumes client brokenness. If you can’t develop this empathy, you will not be able to develop trust and safety in the relationship. Your client, whether the client is an individual or organization, should feel seen, heard, understood, validated, respected, and accepted by you. When this happens, your client can be sure that expressing their truth will be met with a non-judgmental, validating willingness to understand. To create a safe container for your relationship to thrive, you must move into their space rather than expecting them to move to yours.

It helps to apply systems thinking when fostering coach-client partnership. Seeing beyond the client into the world they inhabit can help you see through a wider lens and recognize how the client generated the perceptions and beliefs they hold. It can help you gain context for their concerns and suggestions. Understanding is the first step to acceptance. It is also vital that you refrain from making mental connections about information the client shares in a world you have not experienced. Instead, ask questions that allow the client to explore possible connections. It is also crucial that the coach doesn’t presume to understand what it is like to be the client. Be forthright when you don’t have experience in their domain and stress that you will listen to understand more. Be open in disclosing that you might say something inaccurate or unhelpful and ask the client to freely challenge the assumption and make a correction. When you make observations or share intuitions with the client, always ask for the client’s input. Questions following an observation or intuition might be, “How does that resonate with you?” or “Am I getting that right?” or “What do you think?” or “What’s it like to hear that?” It is also yielding direction to the client. When you find yourself thinking, “I don’t know what to ask,” or “I don't know where to go from here,” or “I’m stuck,” that is usually an indicator that the right next move is to ask the client. It may help to understand that you and the client are a system. When you are not sure where to go, this is an expression of the system. It may be telling you that you are trying to lead and are unsure where to go because the next move belongs to the client. Always listen to what the system is telling you. Be vulnerable enough to ask, “What would be the most helpful direction for us to go now?” or “Where shall we go from here?” or “What else would you like to say?” This passing of the power shows the coach’s willingness to be okay with not knowing what to do, and it offers a full partnership with the client. Chapter 16 - Coaching for Sustainability  For an Agile coach, one of the most important things to think about is, “What will happen when I’m no longer here?” From day one, you need to be thinking about what will happen when the job is done. Technically you might be done when the contract is over. But let's assume for a moment that the contract doesn’t determine when you disengage, you do. We don’t believe that an external Agile coach should find a permanent home with an organization. External Agile coaches should focus on getting the client up and running and developing sustainable ways to continue improving without rolling back when the external coach leaves. Sustaining Agile means continually responding to change, and continuously learning, and continuously improving without being dependent on an external coach to keep the effort stable. Agile is Never the Goal What do you mean, Agile is not the goal? Of course, it’s the goal! That's why the client hired an Agile coach. This might be hard to hear, but it’s the most important lesson you need to learn if you are doing Agile coaching. Agile is not the goal - business results are the goal. If your client

believes Agile is the goal and you are marching to their orders, you’ve got a lot to learn about Agile coaching. Too many times we have worked with organizations and when we question them about why they are adopting Agile methods, frameworks, and practices, the answer is some version of, “I don’t know.” If the client does not know why they are adopting Agile, they shouldn’t be doing it. Not that Agile won’t work. Sure, it will help them improve. The question is, what outcomes are they looking for with the improvements? What return on investment do they want to get if they successfully implement Agile?  In our other chapters in this book, we offer several methods that you can use to work with your client to identify the business results they want to achieve and believe that Agile is the solution to their problem. Without understanding the business results the client wants to get; you won’t know what to focus your efforts on when partnering with them to get Agile started. You might be thinking, everyone knows how to get Agile started. Do training and put people in cross functional teams and help them figure out how to do the ceremonies well. Make sure they are doing daily Scrums (standups), writing user stories, having planning sessions, doing backlog refinement, doing a sprint review, and most importantly doing retrospectives that are fun and engaging. Okay. Good. How do you know that’s what they need? If they are doing all the Scrum events, what business results will that impact? What outcomes will the company see because of the great team meetings? Agile is not plug and play. It’s not something you install the same way every time.  Let's assume for the sake of argument that when creating your well-formed outcomes with the client, they prioritize the number one business problem they are trying to solve: revenue reduction. Customers are abandoning their product, a web and mobile application, because the quality is horrible. They have already identified that the problem in production isn’t that developers are introducing new features and functionality that has defects. The core problem is that they can’t move as fast as their customers need them to and integration and regression tests take weeks to run, so instead of doing full testing they spot check and push to production. Then when the new code is introduced, it works fine but it breaks several other things. The company’s profits have dropped 35% over the past 6 months and there is a continuing downward trend. If they don’t get this fixed, they’re going to be out of business in 12-15 months. Someone recommended Agile so they figured they would give it a try. How does the plug and play starting point of, teach them Scrum, put them in cross functional teams, and make sure they know how to manage a backlog and perform Scrum events address the number one business problem the company needs to solve? It doesn’t. Creating sustainable change in the company is not about getting them to adopt new processes. It’s about getting them to identify the business problems they need to solve and making the changes that solve those problems. Every company won’t need the same cookie cutter

installation plan. If they do, there’s a problem. If they do, the coach is likely leading the engagement and installing the equivalent of vanity metrics. “How many Agile teams can we stand up in three months?” It doesn’t matter how many teams you stand up. If the business problems are not being solved, you are wasting your time and your client’s money. The goal is never Agile. The goal is always business results. The Client Can Solve It Stepping in to take over solving the client’s problems for them is not sustainable. At best, such an approach gets compliance and not true change. At worst, it fails completely. It fails because the solution is not coming from the people who must implement it. As previously mentioned, the client is the expert on their company, not the coach - especially if that coach is external.  Allowing the client to devise their own solutions is vital for several reasons. For starters, you may have seen their problem before, but not in their environment. Only the client knows their internal system well enough to decide what will work and what will not work. If we simply dictate what will work for them, we’re just pushing the solution on them. Not only could our proposed solution totally fail in their environment, but pushing a solution is not coaching. “Just do this” is pushing the solution. It’s also an incredibly oversimplified point of view. For companies with tens of thousands of employees and multiple moving parts, “Just do this” could involve hundreds or even thousands of changes. Some of those changes are business choices, and companies may not be able to change them so easily, or at all. The client is the one who must live with the implemented solutions to their problems. We don’t. Their solutions must work for them. Their solutions also need to be sustainable, so they continue to work going forward. It’s not our company. We don’t have to live with it. That’s an incredibly important point to keep in mind. Michael says, “Partner with the client and let them come up with their own solutions. Not only do they have to live with the results of the solution they design, but they are the ones who must implement the course of action they decide to take. An Agile coach can be a source of information, but not the source of the solution.” Indicators of Sustainability We have listed several conditions that give an indication that the change being adopted by the organization is sustainable. There are others, and each client is different. However, if you partner with the client to find ways to create these conditions, they will be well on their way to having sustainability. Culture of Learning: This means that learning is valued throughout the company, and on multiple levels. This striving for continued learning is built into the company’s core and will become integral, as reflected in everything from job descriptions to the everyday behavior of managers. The organization is moving forward, learning new things, and implementing them without the coach prompting or pointing the way. Experimentation is happening and when new methods are found that solve problems the organization has, they are shared with others.

Teams are teaching teams and there is a mentality of ownership and a self-enforcement of continuous improvement.  Continuous Improvement Cycles: When a company can implement inspection and adaptation on a regular cycle, as well as accurately analyze and measure the results of those changes, that is an indication that it is ready to sustain agility. But the key to this, is its being continuous. Every single quarter or week, at multiple levels or functions, potential improvements are considered. If implemented, feedback, quantitative and otherwise, is gathered about the benefits of the change.   Change Based on the Company’s Context; Not Copying the Success of Others: The successful change comes from within. It needs to be developed based on the needs and strengths of an individual company. To simply copy the success of another company ignores that no two companies are alike. A giraffe’s neck would not work for a mouse; likewise, one company’s operating model or culture may not work for another company. To be sustainable a company must be able to innovate and create in ways that are designed for its individual strengths and success. A Method to Measure Experiments: This is more than having experiments that are measurable or a system for measuring. Rather it is a change in mindset. An experiment is not actually experimenting if it is not given the space to fail. A company is not sustainable on its own until it is freely able to implement trials that are allowed to fail. And additionally, systems must be in place to learn from those failures to adapt for future trials. Evidence of Sustainability: Perhaps the most surefire way for a coach to know the company is ready for them to move on is to simply leave and come back. One way to accomplish this is by achieving a measure of sustained agility with one section of a company, and then leaving to work with another part of the company for several months before returning to see how the section did on their own. The End of Coaching May Never Come Remember that these are just possible signs that a company has achieved sustainability. Ideally there is an interplay of several markers. And, over time, every Agile coach will identify other markers that serve as signposts of sustainability. It is important to understand that many organizations will never achieve a sustainable Agile transformation. Some engagements will end with sustainability. Some engagements will be a maintainable one-time improvement. Others will revert to the old way of operating. This isn’t necessarily a failure of the coach, it’s a symptom of the client system. Mental Models Here are four mental models that help coaches support organizations in achieving sustainability.

1.  Double Loop Learning and Improvement: Most organizations reflect on execution, but do not reflect on goals, policies, and structure with the same intensity and frequency. Chris Argyris, who first described double loop learning, gives the example of a thermostat set to 68: single loop learning involves raising and lowering the temperature, so it is 68; double loop learning involves reflecting on whether 68 is the right temperature. 2.  Radical Transformation: What are the “untouchables” in the organization that cannot be changed? Apple Computer took the Computer off its company name and went into business selling digital music and phones for more profit. And IBM switched from hardware to services. Not holding on to rigid notions of identity, but instead being open to changing everything about the business, let these companies radically innovate and adapt. To the degree that a company can do this, its Agile transformation is more likely to be sustainable and to lead to success. 3.  Four-Frame Model:  The four frames are structural, political, symbolic and human. The key is helping the client to not only view an organization through these four lenses, but also making sure that they are able to act based on that understanding.  4.  Focus on Leadership: An organization is only ever as Agile as its leaders. How are leaders invested in agility, not only in the company’s but in their personal participation in achieving that agility. 5. Various Organizational Change Management Models: Models such as Kotter, Adkar, Nudge, Kubler-Ross, Bridges, and Satir are various models that can be used with thinking about how to bring about sustainable change in organizations.  Practices to Achieve Sustainable Agility Here are six practices worth mentioning that can support creating a sustainable Agile company 1.  Encourage Communities of Practice (CoPs): These highly organic communities can be encouraged and nurtured by Agile coaches, but from there they are meant to flourish on their own. CoPs are examples of cooperative learning across multiple levels of a company, creating an ideal situation for a culture of learning. 2.  Develop a Coaching System within the Organization: Focus on developing internal coaches and mentors that will stay with the organization and continue to partner with them over time. Scrum Masters are a standard role that involves coaching. Also look for people who can be developed into technical, business, product and innovation coaches and mentors. 3.  Retrospective Practices: An examination of the past to improve the future is a common practice in highly Agile organizations. Understanding a complex system is not easy. If it is easy, then it is not being understood. One specific practice that can help is Toyota’s A3 Report which, when done well, can feel like a root canal.  4.  Amplifying What Is Working and Implementing Successful Communication and Sharing Patterns: If one part of the company finds something that works successfully, what

good does that do the organization at large if the message doesn’t get out? Buurtzorg is a nationwide home nursing organization founded in 2006. Though employing 9000, they are broken up into 900 different teams. At Buurtzorg, nurses who find successful practices directly share them with other nursing teams through a company-wide messaging system instead of petitioning management for approval to roll out the improvement. 5.  Innovation Events: Hack-a-thons, Code Jams, Code Fests, call them whatever you want. These types of events ensure that the organization is taking the time to innovate and improve. When employees are saddled with too many deadlines or the production goals are too tight, that means there’s nothing left over for the experimentation and innovation that leads to agility. These events can help. 6.  Creating an Executive Agile Council: This is a team that is authorized to help agility spread throughout the company. It is typically composed of people from multiple levels and from different functional areas. 
Chapter 17 - Coaching Values and Principles Coaching Agile Values and Principles True or False: As an Agile enterprise coach, your goal is to uphold the four values and 12 principles outlined in the Agile Manifesto — while enforcing those values to ensure every single client does the same. Before you answer, be aware that this is a trick question. The first half of the statement is true. You certainly do want to uphold the values and principles in your coaching. But the second part of the statement is false. While you do want to introduce clients to the Agile values and principles, it’s not your job to enforce them to ensure compliance. The coach serves more like the messenger and less like the enforcer. In fact, you’re not an enforcer at all. Coaches need to walk the Agile walk, but your clients don’t necessarily have to. That decision is up to them. We’ll get deeper into this concept later in the chapter. We’ll also look at embedding the values and principles into the culture, coaching a client according to their values and principles, and identifying and coaching anti-patterns. Before we move forward, let’s review the four values and 12 principles found in the Agile Manifesto to ensure we’re all on the same page from the get-go. Four Values: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools Working software over comprehensive documentation Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

## Page 134

 
134 
Responding to change over following a plan   12 Principles: 1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. 2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. 3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. 4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done. 6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. 7. Working software is the primary measure of progress. 8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. 10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential. 11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. 12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. Sensing Values Every organization you meet is going to have its own set of values. One of your first tasks as an Agile enterprise coach is to sense what those values are. Sure, you could pour over lists, documents, and well-written vision statements to figure that out. But there’s a magic trick here you can use instead: Just ask people. You want to understand how the culture is already in alignment and not in alignment with the organization’s values, and the best way to find out is by asking those within the organization. Surveying management, various teams and different functional areas will give you a lot of good information. You want to help the client see how the organization is honoring (or not honoring) the values and principles. Cherie does a collaborative exercise to bring this transparency. First, facilities a breakout discussion on the full intent of the values and principles. (Note: this might be several events where the group of people look at a few items each time you meet.) Once the participants are clear on what the value or principle in question means, the gather in group to brainstorm three things: How is this value/principle expressed in our organization today? 

---

## Page 135

 
135 
In what ways is our organization suppressing or violating this value/principle today? What will need to change for us to get the best results while honoring this value/principle The output of these sessions is an improvement backlog. The items are categorized into things the teams can handle, things that need to be elevated to managers to handle, and things that are systemic issues that need bigger solutions and leadership involvement to change. One method Michael uses to survey the organization is to list the four values, along with a scale that runs from one to 10. Ask people to rate where they are with each of the four values, and then ask them where they want to be. Let’s say for each of the four values, the organization is currently at two. Ask them where they want to be. If the client finds they are not honoring their values, your next step is to ask them what they want to do. A client may not want to slide it all the way over to 10. Coaches need to respect that. This holds true with the values as well as the principles. Michael says, “One of the big mistakes coaches make is assuming every client wants to be perfect on Agile techniques. The coach assumes the organization wants to take everything to the max, take every category to an 11. This is a surefire way for the coach to end up frustrated. Coaches who don’t respect the client’s desires typically have an agenda all their own. You want to avoid that. Let the client drive the change.” How to Coach According to Values and Principles When the client appears to violate a value or principle, it’s crucial for the coach to refrain from slipping into a place of judgement. Coaches need to start from a place of curiosity, always phrasing things in terms of curiosity rather than judgement. Rather than admonishing a client, be curious about what’s happening for the client and what problem the client is trying to solve with the action they took. Act like a partner to the client because that’s what you are. Explain how the situation appears to you. Then inquire about their perspective. Focus on the outcomes, not the outputs. There may be a dozen different behaviors or activities that achieve the same desired results. Encourage your client to come up with behaviors or activities that align with the values and principles and will get them the outcome they desire. Then, collaborate with the client to design a process that incorporates those behaviors, to get more of what they want while being consistent with their values and principles. Coaching Frustrations Using Values and Principles When people within the organization are confused or frustrated, it’s often an indication that some value or principle is not being honored. People will feel impeded, as if things are not flowing smoothly. Emotions are a great gauge for checking in on values and principles, raising a red flag that it’s time for a check in. These types of issues are great for a 1-1 or group coaching session. At a high level, this is what a coaching session would cover. First, allow them to ventilate a bit about what’s frustrating them. People need to know that their concerns are heard and validated. Find out what specifically is frustrating them whether it is an action, a decision, or 

---

136 
something else. Then, ask what problem someone was attempting to solve by doing “x” that is causing the frustration. Let them brainstorm some ideas and get perspective on why “x” is happening. Then, ask them to reflect on which values or principles are being violated with “x.” Once they have identified the values or principles that are being violated, they will get a better perspective of what antipatterns look like. They will also be able to see clearer how violating the Agile values and principles creates frustration even when people don’t realize consciously that there is a violation. This is because the Agile values and principles inherently lead to a better work environment. When violated they lead to frustration. Lastly, ask them how they can get the same results without violating the value or principle. Let them brainstorm ideas and experiments to try. Close by having them develop a plan for their next actions to resolve the frustration and solve the original problem at the same time. Anti-Patterns From an Agile coaching perspective, we could define a pattern as something in our experience that has led to success. Maintaining a pattern doesn’t necessarily mean we follow a precise template to achieve that success; it’s instead a way of encapsulating the results. A pattern takes you to desirable results while remaining in alignment with Agile values and principles. An anti-pattern does just the opposite. It’s a decision, action, or solution that solves the presenting issue but violates the Agile values or principles and ultimately leads to unwanted impacts. Even though the “anti-” prefix and the thought of unwanted results may make you think you must shut out all anti-patterns, that’s not always the case. Working from home is an example of a common anti-pattern. This previously non-ideal behavior has become acceptable for many businesses as stay-at-home orders were put into place during the Covid-19 pandemic. Circumstances may put anti-patterns into play when it comes to business decisions, but you don’t want to make them a habit when it comes to enterprise coaching. Coaching Anti-patterns to look out for include: There aren’t only anti-patterns that violate Agile values and principles. Some anti-patterns are exhibited by coaches, and they violate coaching competencies, ethics, or mindset. The examples listed are “Do no harm” violations. Collusion: This occurs when two people talk about a third person behind the third person’s back. The two people are colluding together, with one enlisting the support of the other against the third. Here you’re not respecting people, not taking them to be complete and whole. You’re conspiring against them. A coach can collude with clients when the client is complaining about others. When the coach jumps in, thinking they are giving empathy, and agrees and allows the conversation to focus on 

---

## Page 137

 
137 
what others are doing that the client can’t change. The coach is colluding with the client to not take responsibility for their own contributions to the problem and to focus on the only thing they can control — their own actions. A coach also colludes with clients when they offer too much support and not enough challenge. If you are watching your client make bad decisions or see them ready to walk off a cliff, and you don’t challenge them, you are colluding with them to continue in their sub-optimal performance. Ninja coaching: This refers to coaching without permission. Coaching is a partnership. You cannot coach someone who has not asked for or agreed to coaching. Every conversation is not intended to be a coaching conversation. Coaching skills are good communication skills so utilizing them in everyday conversations is fine. However, if you find you are trying to move the person you are chatting with forward when they haven’t asked you to do that, you are ninja coaching. If people say things like, “You’re doing that coaching thing to me!” It's time to take a good look at your interactions. Policing: If you’re acting as the enforcer of the Agile way of doing things, you’re not coaching. You’re policing. Here you’re taking control away from the client. The client needs to be the one to make the change; control needs to always be in the hands of the client. Focus on what they want to improve or change, not on making sure Agile by the book is adhered to. Superhero mentality: Coaches aren’t meant to swoop in and rescue an organization. If a client cries, “Come fix this!” and you do, you are falling into this mentality. The goal of Agile coaching is not to fix an organization. We serve as guides, not superheroes. If you need to save your clients, reflect on why. The impulse to save them might be a habit that needs to be broken, or it could be something deeper. Sometimes saving others and protecting them gives people a sense of value or serves some inner need. If that’s the case, then you are focusing on your needs instead of the client’s needs. Sometimes the urge to save others is because you are assuming that the client is broken or not competent to save themselves.  Which brings us to the next point. Not seeing clients as competent: There’s a very simple marker for this anti-pattern: simply review the thoughts that run through your head about the client. If you’re thinking how you can’t believe they’re in an executive position, or how you could do a much better job running the business than they do, you are falling into this trap. When you get frustrated because clients are doing things that are not right, you may be judging their competence. Instead, get curious. Give them the benefit of the doubt that if they are doing something that seems strange to you, there must be a valid reason. Judging: Judging involves assessing if a client is doing good or bad. It’s not for the coach to evaluate if the client is doing a good job. The coach doesn’t decide if decisions or solutions determined by the client are right or wrong. Clients are supposed to evaluate themselves. Coaches can certainly help them get raw data to review, but it’s not the coach’s job to do the actual reviewing.

Being sucked into the system: Also known as being “in the grip,” this occurs when a coach becomes emotionally invested in the client or situation. The coach can no longer hold emotional distance from the organization. Warning signs include coming home exhausted or finding yourself hoping and praying everything works out. This is an indicator that you are sympathizing with the client rather than empathizing. When you empathize with a client it’s like seeing them fall overboard and recognizing that they likely need a life preserver and help to get back in the boat. When you sympathize with a client it's more like seeing them fall overboard and jumping in after them when you know you can’t swim. Now both of you are likely to drown. Taking sides: Disagreements inside an organization are not uncommon, and it’s the coach’s job to remain a neutral third party. If you advocate on behalf of one person, group, or viewpoint, you are taking sides. You want to help ensure all voices are heard, even the marginalized ones, without bolstering one side or the other. Fearing for your job: There’s a big difference between doing what the client wants and doing what the client needs. If you’re leaning toward the former just to save your job, you’re falling into the trap. You’re also fueling a fear-based mentality that may be rife throughout the entire organization. Coaches need to be okay with keeping their job or not keeping their job if they’re doing what’s right. This might be a hard way of thinking because the reality is everyone needs income. However, if you constantly make decisions using, “How can I keep my job?” as criteria, you are making fear-based decisions and those aren’t helpful for you or your clients. Learn to separate your needs from the needs of the client. Focus on what the client needs when coaching. Focus on what you need in private or with a coach or coaching supervisor. Using vanity metrics to prove your value: Vanity metrics are typically based on activities, like how many people you coached, how many attendees came to your seminar, or how many seminars you’ve held in the past year. As we’ve said before, the number of Agile teams you’ve started and the number of successful ceremonies you’ve attended only show that you are doing something with your time. Instead, focus on the business outcomes the client wants to achieve, create clear measures of success and progress for those. Use these as the measures that indicate that you are helping to drive business outcomes. [Michael] Recently I had a client focusing on business development. He wanted to reach out to a one-million-person non-profit organization to develop a relationship that might lead to a business deal. Our coaching helped him figure out how to effectively reach out to them. He not only started a relationship but went on to close a partnership deal with the non-profit. This is what matters: business results. Coaching a single person with a powerful outcome is worth much more than coaching 1,000 people with nothing to show for it.

Chapter 18: Experimentation   Running Experiments If Christopher Columbus had used the traditional approach to planning we see today, he would have likely ended up at the bottom of the ocean. The traditional approach involves mapping out a step-by-step game plan that is executed to achieve a promised goal at the end of the road.  One problem is that anything that falls short of reaching the goal is considered a failure. Organizations may try, again and again, sticking with their approach no matter what, even if dismal results appear to be the only thing on the horizon.  Another challenge is that the traditional approach only tends to work in a fairly stable, predictable, and understandable environment. The massive, unknown stretch of the Atlantic Ocean in the late 1400s hardly counts as any of the above.  Columbus never reached his goal of finding a westward water route from Europe to Asia, but he’s not considered a failure. He’s considered a great explorer for what he did find instead. He didn’t stumble across the Americas by adhering to a rigid plan that dictated his every action no matter what. He instead was looking at the environment every single moment, consistently adjusting the sails to best catch the wind, and constantly adapting to changes as quickly as needed.  In short, he was inspecting and adapting to change. Adapting to change is one of the Agile Manifesto values, and this chapter examines the practice and culture of experimentation as a way to be more adaptable.  What Experiments Are Running experiments simply refers to trying things out and learning from what happens. We are not referring to “experiment” in the scientific sense, although we will certainly draw on some aspects of a scientific experiment. Organizational experiments can run the gamut from a small change in how paperwork is filed all the way to a larger restructuring of a company process.  Unlike experiments in the scientific sense, there may be no hypothesis that’s to be supported, refuted, or validated. It’s essential to have various options while we experiment in our coaching approach to see which experiments yield favorable results.   Probes into the Unknown Thinking of experiments as probes can be helpful. They are probes exploring an unknown map, just like Columbus, where you don’t necessarily know where to go next until you gather more information.

You’re sending out probes into unchartered land. You need to know where the food is, where the dangers are, where the water supply is, where you can find shelter and other things you need to survive.  Rather than running one experiment at a time, you’re able to run many probes in parallel. Multiple probes can be sent out at the same time, all of them looking for answers that align with what needs to be achieved.  As you get into the groove of running experiments, you’ll be able to run probes at faster rates and in greater quantities. You may also strengthen the ability to quickly shift from a probe that’s not working into a new option that might.  Not an Easy Process Sending out probes is not easy, especially when faced with organizations that are cemented into doing things the traditional way. To get an organization from where it is to where it wants to go is going to require changes. This could include changes in processes, changes in the management system, or changes that require additional training.  Even when a change is for the better, some organizations may become defensive and resistant19 about giving up what they’ve become accustomed to. In fact, most of them do. Resistance against change can come from any combination of factors, such as: ● Company culture: Change runs the risk of disrupting the company’s cultural equilibrium, which may produce unwanted consequences for certain employees ● Company structure: Companies tend to have set structures that have become rigid. Certain people and departments may only interact with other select people or departments. Change can knock people off their well-known perches. ● Sunk costs: Organizations may have already invested in a plan to reach a specific goal, and they may look at changing that plan as losing their investment. They can also fear the potentially high cost of change, and the risk of losing money in yet another venture if the ideas don’t pan out. ● Existing contracts and customers: Changing course may come with a change in existing contractual agreements with vendors, suppliers, and individuals. Companies can also fear losing key customers who may not be happy with a change. Even though organizations may bring on enterprise coaches to support the changes they so desperately need, some level of resistance may still be part of the package. Trying to push change through a single individual in the organization is not going to work. Our aim is to acknowledge and accept the factors that may be birthing resistance, and work within them.  Right Sized Plan It’s likewise crucial to create experiments that are the right size for the company. Not only the right size in terms of the amount and types of changes they may require, but the right size for

their operations and budget. You don’t want to propose multi-million-dollar experiments that involve restructuring entire organizations when the budget is in the thousands.  A right sized approach is also one that’s the right fit for what the individuals within the company feel they can afford in terms of time and effort. The probes must fit the organization, with ideas they can actually try and are comfortable with. You never want to make a company feel uncomfortable, or as if they’re biting off far more than they can chew.  You’re not going to enter a situation and say, “We’re going to cross the Atlantic or bust.” You first need to figure out how to cross the river, then the Great Lakes, and then the ocean can be next in line.  You want to start with a situation as it is. Ask how big of an experiment can we do? How much can we change at this phase of our development?  No Plan Set in Stone Experiments differ from the standard mindset when it comes to sticking to a plan. Tasks outlined in traditional plans sometimes appear to take on the power of overriding law for what’s to be done, and when.  It doesn’t matter if the plan is obviously failing, employees and customers are unhappy, or if the business is losing money while the plan is in motion. It needs to stay in motion, regardless, until it’s seen all the way to the end.  Running experiments under the Agile approach to coaching is quite the opposite. There is no plan set months, or even years in advance. You instead devise and run a set of experiments that may or may not move the organization in the desired direction. Based on the results of those experiments, you can then decide what’s next.  Unlike the traditional approach that outlines a set goal at the end, we enterprise coaches cannot tell our clients what the results and benefits of each experiment are going to be. We’ll only know that after the fact. Also, unlike the traditional approach, someone is not simply collecting data on what’s been done. Yes, gathering data is still part of the process, but so is learning. Everyone is learning as the experiments are taking place and adapting or adjusting course as that learning is happening. If one experiment doesn’t work, you need to be willing to switch quickly to the next one – without considering the first experiment a failure.  Michael: I was coaching a 40-person team for about six weeks when I found myself getting stuck. The mistake I made was to not experiment. I had picked a coaching approach in advance and was banging my head against the wall, as the approach was not working. Instead of listening to the environment, listening to the people, and acknowledging the obvious signs that the approach wasn’t working, I dug my heels in further. “I know I’m right,” I told myself. “This has to work.”

 Now I know it’s about being humble. Being flexible. My ego insisted I was right, railed against changing course. But I needed to be doing something from a place of curiosity, not ego. Curiosity lets me approach things with wonder, with a true fascination with what may work and what may not. Ego holds onto its insistence that it’s right, even when the ship is clearly sinking.  Redefining 'Failure' Regardless of the outcome of any given experiment, none of them are considered failures. That’s because something valuable is gained along the way. Even if the experiment does not provide an outcome that is particularly beneficial to the client, everyone involved in the experiment has learned something.  They are better off now than they were before the experiment began, as they now have additional knowledge. Even knowledge of what doesn’t work is helpful, as it can serve as a guide moving forward for setting up the next set of experiments.  With this type of approach, lots of things are not going to work. That’s not only perfectly fine, but it’s also actually expected. Things aren’t always going to work when you’re probing into unexplored territory and trying something new.  The only way to prevent so-called failure is to never do anything new. It’s essential to have a culture and mindset that allows for trying new things that may not work. You don’t want to yell and scream at the existing system. You want to take what you’re given and determine how it can be made better.  The harder the problem, the more valuable it is. And the more learning you’re going to have to do to solve it. More challenging problems are going to require much more experimentation than easy problems, providing many more chances for the experimentation not to work.  Coaches need to keep this in mind to ensure you don’t get frustrated and start doubting yourself. Self-management is crucial to keep your own emotions and needs in check. Another key thing a coach needs to do during the experimentations is to not give up.  Don’t throw up your hands in despair when yet another experiment may not deliver the results you want. Simply move on to the next option that might.  -- Michael: I was working with a 300-person startup, and we started off by holding one-hour weekly meetings. At the first few meetings, there was a lot of fanfare and tons of people in attendance. But the latest meeting only had two people in attendance, and one dropped out after 30 minutes.

“Wow,” I said to myself. “This is obviously not working.” I needed to better communicate the value proposition of the collaboration we were trying to achieve. But I also needed to be humble and experiment with different approaches.   I started thinking that maybe I needed to cut down the meeting time to 30 minutes, hold meetings every other week, or send emails instead of expecting people to take time out for a meeting. Simply trying to force my way to work was just me thrusting my own agenda on an organization instead of listening to the organization and paying attention to what I must learn. The audience is clearly telling me that the meetings are not valuable enough for them to spend an hour a week attending.   Experiment Template Setting up experiments can be much more effective when you have some type of template to follow. The following template might be helpful: ● What is the current state or situation? ● In the current situation ○ Describe what is going well: ○ Describe what is not going well: ● What is going well or not going well in terms of ○ Specific facts or statistics ○ Emotions ○ Needs ● What is needed to improve the situation? What is the overall direction we need to travel? ● Here are things we can try out to move in the desired direction.  How are people feeling inside and outside the organization? What do they need to have to improve or enhance the situation? Traditional approaches may not always, or ever, take emotions and needs into account.  Once it’s clear what’s lacking in the current state, the client can then establish a north-star goal, or the overall direction in which the client wants the organization to move. All the experiments the company runs can then be designed to proceed in the direction of the goal.     Example of Experiment Using Template Let’s use a dip in customer service satisfaction as an example of the template. It might look something like this: ● What is the current state or situation? ○ Customer satisfaction down 20% ● In the current situation

○ Describe what is going well: Customer service reps are very attentive to every detailed need of customers they help ○ Describe what is not going well: Reps spending more time than typical with each customer, leaving many customers waiting for extended periods to talk to a rep or receive an email response ● What is going well or not going well in terms of ○ Specific facts or statistics: Customers who do get help are happy about the extended time the support team spends with them ○ Emotions: ■ Customers who fall between the cracks are frustrated by lack of attention ■ Employees frustrated by customers complaining about lack of attention, fed up with explaining the same solutions over and over to most customers who call for help, fed up with being yelled at by customers who are waiting to be helped, distracted and overwhelmed by customer service requests piling up and needing answers ○ Needs: ■ Customers need support, attention, security; need to feel content, secure and cared for ■ Customer service reps need appreciation, respect, encouragement; need to feel content, helpful, intrigued, relaxed and as if workload is under control ● What is needed to improve the situation? What is the overall direction we need to travel? ○ Increase customer satisfaction rate to be on par or above past performance ○ Communication, clarity, more efficient response process ○ Meet emotional and human needs of customers and employees as outlined above ● Here are things we can try out to move in the desired direction. ○ Automate certain customer service requests that keep coming up again and again ○ Invest in a chat bot to handle routine requests ○ Set up automated response to email requests to ensure customers at least know their emails have been received ○ Assign different customer service reps to work in different teams, with teams each responsible for different segment of customers needing help ○ Hire more customer service reps ○ Provide more information and instructions on website ○ The list goes on….  Benefits of Running Experiments Running experiments comes with a multitude of benefits, with the foremost being that we are modeling what we are teaching. As enterprise coaches, we’re constantly instructing companies to take an Agile approach – and we need to be Agile ourselves. We need to listen to our audience and be willing to learn from so-called failure.

The process of collecting and examining data throughout the experiments is another huge benefit. Data serves to drive decision-making. As the company changes, it finds itself in a different place so continuously examining data is critical.  We can’t say we’ll be in the same place we’re currently in in a month from now. If we’ve done a month’s worth of work, we’re going to be in a different place that requires different experiments. The traditional method of creating a one-year plan puts forth the proposition that we’re able to predict where we’ll be 11 months from now. It expects the tactics outlined in the plan will still be relevant and effective. They may very well not be. If we’re disciplined and impeccable in our ability to gather and analyze data throughout the experiments, we’ll have a good idea about where we are. We’ll also know what has worked and what hasn’t worked to get there.  One more remarkable benefit of running experiments is being able to face reality as it is. It shows we both recognize and accept that the world is unknown and highly unknowable. We don’t live in a clockwork universe. We live in a VUCA world.  Experiments Ideal in Our VUCA World The military concept of VUCA describes today’s world quite accurately. The VUCA acronym20 comes from the U.S. Army, which coined it to describe the post-Cold War environment. VUCA stands for: ● Volatile ● Uncertain ● Complex ● Ambiguous  This same environment exists for many organizations in the corporate world. Rapid change makes the environment volatile. The lack of predictability makes it uncertain. The unknown cause and effect of various forces leads to complexity. And there is an enormous amount of ambiguity when plunging into new situations. Experiments are the ideal way to determine what works and what doesn’t in a VUCA world.  One final benefit of experiments is giving us coaches the green light to say the three little words that have instilled fear in many for centuries: “I don’t know.” Not only are these words incredibly freeing, but they allow us to approach each situation with a beginner’s mind, a child’s sense of wonder.  Yes, it’s a far cry from the standard mindset where experts are supposed to know the answer, but it’s also the way some of the most exceptional growth and discoveries are made. We’re not trying to fit preconceived notions of what we “should” be doing according to some extended plan. We’re looking at what works in this situation, for these particular people, for these particular circumstances.  20   https://chiefexecutive.net/understanding-vuca-environment/

 We’re constantly re-examining what we’re doing and recreating ourselves to be the most effective in the current situation. This dynamic way of doing things can often bring about the most amazing results. If anyone out there needs additional proof, simply ask Christopher Columbus.  After mapping out the challenges and possible experiments using the template it’s time to start running experiments. You could just try things and see what works. And it will be more helpful if you define how you will know that the experiment is successful in terms of making the expected impact and adopting the experiment as a new way of working.  Scientific experimentation lends us another process too that can be helpful when running experiments: Testing with hypotheses.   Let's look at the list of experiments defined in the example above.  ● Here are things we can try out to move in the desired direction. ○ Automate certain customer service requests that keep coming up again and again ○ Invest in a chat bot to handle routine requests ○ Set up automated response to email requests to ensure customers at least know their emails have been received ○ Assign different customer service reps to work in different teams, with teams each responsible for different segment of customers needing help ○ Hire more customer service reps ○ Provide more information and instructions on website  The experiment template gets you to a list of things to try and the hypothesis tells you what to look for in the experiments. Keep in mind that you may get a different result than expected. Sometimes that result is great, and you’ll want to adopt it and other times it's not so great and you’ll learn what you don’t want to continue doing.   The goal of the experiments is to impact the list generated in the template. So, the hypothesis should look at the experiments through this lens. The experiments should be contributing to moving towards these outcomes. ○ Increase customer satisfaction rate to be on par or above past performance ○ Communication, clarity, more efficient response process ○ Meet emotional and human needs of customers and employees as outlined above  A quick and easy template for hypothesis is: Experiment: [ High level statement of experiment] We believe that [by doing whatever experiment you are doing] [this will result] Which will: [impact on the outcomes you are trying to achieve] We will know that we have a successful outcome when: [measurement criteria]

Timebox for experiment  Let's take this one and develop a hypothesis statement: Experiment: Provide more information and instructions on website We believe that: by providing easily identified and accessible information and instructions on the website we will reduce customer service wait times by ___ %.  ● We expect customers who check the website before calling will utilize the website information to answer most of their questions which will reduce the number of calls coming into the call center and thereby reduce the overall wait time. ● We expect call center personnel to share links with customers directing them to the information which will reduce contact time with each customer and reduce overall customer wait times.  To determine if this experiment successfully brings us closer to our goals of increasing the customer satisfaction rate, we will measure the following things: ● Number of calls to the call center month over month [we expect the number of calls to be reduced] ● Wait time to reach a call center representative [we expect it to go down] ● Number of visits to the information on the site  ● Length of time visitors stayed on the pages with the information ● Interaction levels with the website information [what they are interacting with and what they are not] ● Percentage of searches that do not produce results [indicates missing information we may want to add] ● Number of emails customer service reps are sending with links ● Trend in customer satisfaction  Measurements and responses: ● We will run baseline measurements at the beginning of the experiment. ● We will review measurements monthly and monitor trends over 6 months. ● If trends are moving in the expected direction we will continue to move from experiment to adoption. ● If trends are not changing, we will investigate adjustments and continue for another 3 months ● If trends are moving in a negative direction, we will pull the information off the site and end the experiment.  Utilizing experiments that produce data helps your client to be able to make educated, evidence-based decisions. It also provides a tangible way for you to show your value as a coach to the organization. Which brings us to the next chapter … Metrics.

Chapter 19: Developing Metrics that Matter [Alex and Cherie will be adding more to this chapter]  Metrics that Work for Agile Coaching   When it comes to proving the value of Agile coaching, which approach do you think works better: ● Telling the CEO that everything’s great, employees and customers are happy, and even the air feels lighter since you’ve started coaching at the organization.   ● Showing the CEO a color-coded graph that indicates company revenue has increased 20% and market share has increased by 12% since you’ve started coaching at the organization.  The second approach is going to win you more credibility—and clients. And it’s all because of metrics.    When it comes to metrics that work for Agile coaching, however, not just any old measurement will do. Not only do you need to be selective about the metrics you choose, but you must be equally fastidious while putting your measurement methods into practice.   This chapter fills you in on metrics that work for Agile coaching. You’ll get a rundown on measurements that make the most sense, best practices for putting them into action, and crucial elements to keep in mind as you help move a company forward toward success.  Metrics Defined  For our purposes, metrics are defined as the results of measuring something. With a definition that’s so straightforward, you may wonder how things could go wrong.  But they can. And rather quickly. That’s why you need to be clear and decisive about what metrics you’re intending to use from the very start.  When you’re looking for measurements that show progress, you’re not looking for team metrics or organizational metrics. And you’re not looking for metrics that show progress in Agile—you want metrics that show progress is being made about business results.   Agile coaching helps to accelerate the business results. But you don’t want measurements related to Agile. You want the numbers related to the actual business results or goals the company is aiming to hit.   ● What goals are being accelerated? ● How do you measure them?

## Page 149

 These questions are best answered during the initial engagement with the organization to ensure you’re all measuring the same thing from the get-go.   Part of the Agile coach’s responsibility is to help companies select the correct metrics. Organizations often have the wrong metrics or are using them incorrectly. For example, a company may say it wants to increase team velocity, which is an admirable goal. But it’s not appropriate as a metric for your purposes.   Michael says, “Many organizations automatically ask us for Agile stuff—metrics related to Agile training or improving the Agile team. CEOs don’t care about metrics related to Agile. They care about metrics that matter to the business, like revenues or market share. Not things like Agile team velocity.”    Since many companies haven’t thought about the different metrics that specifically align with business results, Agile coaches must help them with this. And, as noted, it’s important to provide this help right from the start.   Keeping Things Balanced  Cherie - add content on Balanced Scorecard  Unless they’re aiming to go out of business, organizations want their metrics to improve. They want more revenue. A greater market share. More products to market, and faster.  Any single metric can be easily gamed. But you also must look at what will be lost. If you’re trying to go up with one of the metrics, another metric is destined to go down. You want to have a set of metrics that balances each other out.   A good example here is companies that want to release products to the customer more frequently. One way to increase the frequency of releases would be to release junk. If the frequency increases in this manner, the quality and/or customer retention is going to decrease.   It’s essential to have a balanced perspective—and a counterweight. You need to know what impact the increase of one metric will have on the others.   The Agile coach helps companies establish metrics that will be valuable to them across the board, going to a higher level of thinking than they are accustomed to. Especially when it comes to keeping things balanced.   Product management expert Roman Pichler takes the concept further with his approach to Balanced Product Scorecards.

Metrics Rules of Thumb  Making metrics work for an organization is easier when you keep several guidelines in mind.   Consider at least three counterbalancing metrics. Once you target a metric, make sure you counterbalance it properly. You need to pay attention to the unintended consequences. What behavior will you drive by targeting a specific metric?    We can again use the speed to market example. You’ll increase the number of releases, but you may end up with tons of junky releases. Counterbalance the speed to market metric with metrics like quality, customer complaints, net promoter score (NPS), and escaped defects.    Know what you can measure. You can measure just about anything—if you’re willing to put in the effort. Figuring out how to collect data for the metric requires effort, as does building out the measurement capability itself. Once an organization is willing to invest in measurement capabilities, it can measure things it didn’t think it could.    Move measurements from subjective to objective. When it comes to measurements, you want to move up the scale from subjective to objective as quickly as possible. On one end of the scale, you’ll find subjective measurements involving opinion and qualitative feedback. The other end has objective measurements involving objective input and quantitative feedback. Companies can move up the scale one step at a time.  Here’s an example involving customer satisfaction:    ● Subjective and qualitative: Involves organization’s opinion and feelings ● I feel our customers are unhappy.   ● Subjective and quantitative: Involves organization’s opinion and quantitative measurement, such as a numeric scale ● On a scale of 1 to 10, our customer satisfaction level is probably around one.    ● Objective and qualitative: Introduces objectivity by gathering input directly from the customer, but still involves customer’s opinion ● I had a hideous experience with the company.    ● Objective and quantitative: Objective input from customers put into quantitative measurement, such as NPS.

151 
● On a scale of 1 to 10, how likely would you be to recommend this company to a colleague?  Disarm the weapons. The move from subjective to objective measurements makes it less likely metrics will be used as a weapon. When feelings and opinion are the basis for measurements, it’s easy for companies to start thinking measurements and key performance indicators (KPIs) are a bad thing.   Once that sentiment sets in, negative feelings come with it. Organizations start to question why they’re measuring things in the first place if all it does is spur negativity and bad results. So, they stop measuring altogether.   That’s the end of metrics—and measuring progress. Now the company has no way of knowing if it’s improving.   Automate as much as possible. Another way to stop companies from dropping metrics is to automate as much of the process as humanly possible. This helps to ensure the process is fast, easy, and error-free.      Michael adds, “You don’t want people sitting around with spreadsheets trying to manually track and calculate numbers. Manually tracking metrics is laborious and prone to errors. Some will stop doing it because it’s so labor-intensive. Others will stop doing it because they’ll start finding mistakes—the “garbage in, garbage out” concept. Tracking measurements manually is the first step towards stopping to track at all.”      Consider dashboards for good visualization. Once you have the metrics, you need to be able to communicate what they’re saying. Dashboards work better than raw numbers for conveying meaning, as do graphs, charts, and other visual elements.    Trends mean more than absolute values. Don’t get hung up on specific numbers with metrics. Look at the overall trends instead. It doesn’t really matter if the customer satisfaction level is a three or four if it’s moving up from the baseline.    Establish baselines. Set up baselines during your initial sessions. Your goal is to measure the impact of Agile engagement, and to ascribe the gain to it. To show the impact of Agile at, say, day 100, you need to know where the organization started.    Test measurements with hypotheses. Is the metric driving the behavior you expect? While you may think the metric is going to cause a certain reaction, you want to make sure that is the case. Check in on it often. Measurements are only useful if they catalyze change. If you’re not getting the change you expect, then you should change the metric.

Gain alignment at the highest level on what the metrics should be. Whatever organization you’re working with, make sure the group of people at the highest echelon is on board with the metrics you’re using.      Michael shares, “It’s not uncommon for those at the VP level to agree on a set of metrics—only to have the SVP say they’re not happy with the way Agile is going. When you show them the metrics that indicate progress, the SVPs will say they don’t agree with metrics. Avoid this scenario by making sure you get the SVPs to align with the specific metrics you intend to use right from the start.”  Measurements at the Team Level  The key to effective metrics at the team level is to understand their purpose. Team measurements are created by the team so the team can better understand itself. Metrics here are a self-awareness and self-improvement tool.  Examples of team metrics are things like lead time and delivery rate. If the team has no way to measure its performance, it has no way of knowing if it’s improving, declining, or staying the same. It also has no way to communicate its effectiveness and value to stakeholders.   Measurements at the Organizational Level  Metrics at the organizational level extend across the entire value stream of the company. These measurements touch everything that touches the customer. Measurements associated with the final product are a good example, as the product may be built by multiple departments or multiple teams.   Product-related metrics can include:  ● Test coverage ● Escaped defects ● How many phone calls the organization is getting about the product  Employee morale is another measurement used by many organizations. It can be measured by looking at things like turnover rate and how often people are calling in sick. The cost of training new people is another useful metric, one that can be particularly helpful for prompting companies to take action to boost morale.  Metrics related to employee morale are leading metrics. They give an advanced indication of how things are going before the business outcome comes to fruition.  Measurements at the Enterprise Level  On the flipside of leading metrics are lagging metrics, which is what you get at the enterprise level. Lagging metrics take a long time to show up, providing insights after

the fact. Depending on what’s being measured, companies may need to wait a year or more for certain metrics.   Examples of enterprise-level metrics include:   ● Return on investment, or ROI ● Market share ● Customer satisfaction levels ● Stock price   Enterprise-level metrics are difficult to associate with a single product, although you can glean valuable insights from looking at trends. It’s also imperative to look at performance relative to the industry.   For instance, let’s say company stock is up by 10%. If the overall stock market is up by 20%, the company’s 10% gain is not necessarily something to celebrate.  But if you’re down 10% while the rest of the industry is down by 20%, your 10% loss can be viewed as a win.   Summing It Up  When selected carefully and used meticulously, metrics are a mighty force—and not just for showing the value of Agile coaching. They are the only way to truly measure progress toward any goal, whether it’s increasing revenue or decreasing employee turnover.   They also serve as checkpoints to ensure a company is heading in the right direction, allowing you to adjust and change course if it’s not. Establishing a set of agreed-upon metrics from the start will go a long way toward bringing everyone involved to the best possible finish.

Chapter 20: Promoting a Learning Organization  Learning Organizations  What’s a good way – if not the only way – for companies to stay competitive in the business environment? While dozens of different strategies and tactics may immediately come to mind, one way is to become a learning organization.   A learning organization is a company that embraces and promotes the concept of continuous learning for all its members. This provides a strong foundation for creating new products, launching new services, solving problems, and updating processes that are no longer serving the whole. It also gives organizations the ability to constantly transform themselves, so they stay current, relevant, and successful.  When we stop learning, we stop growing. Companies that aren’t constantly learning end up repeating the same old processes again and again – no matter what else is going on in the business or worldwide environment. Any changes they do try to implement are typically only surface changes that are short-lived. This is the opposite of agility: instead of adapting to change, these companies are resisting change.  On the flipside, companies that are continuously learning can continuously grow – which lets them continuously innovate, adapt, and ultimately thrive. This chapter gives you the lowdown on learning organizations. You’ll get a look at its history, what’s required to create a culture of learning, and several examples of methods that are helpful for facilitating learning through an organization.   History of the Concept  The learning organization concept was coined by Peter Senge, and he keeps the definition to the point. He says that a learning organization is “a group of people working together collectively to enhance their capacities to create results they really care about.”  The concept started hitting the mainstream in the early 1990s, with the publication of Senge’s book21 “The Fifth Discipline.” Here he outlines the five characteristics, or disciplines, of a learning organization. They are:  ● Shared Vision, with all employees on the same page with where an organization needs to go. ● Mental Models, which are generalizations and presumptions that influence people’s actions. For instance, the hierarchical structure is a typical mental model in most companies. Changing mental models starts by examining your own beliefs and the behavior that results from them.  21  https://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Discipline-Practice-Learning-Organization/dp/0385517254

● Personal Mastery, which refers to the strength and endurance required to be proactive, to keep learning to keep achieving desired results. ● System Thinking, the fifth discipline, is the ability to examine patterns within an organization by looking at the organization as a whole – not as small, unrelated, and independently managed parts.   Transformation Challenges  Organizations don’t automatically become learning organizations. In fact, the opposite is generally true. As companies expand, they tend to lose their capacity to learn. Structures and thinking become rigid. Things become stagnant and stale.   Transforming a stagnant organization into a learning organization can be just the remedy the company needs, but it is not without its challenges. Some of these challenges include:  ● No time: Other issues may keep taking priority over a wholesale culture change.  ● No guidance: If the organization doesn’t have efficient and effective help or training to initiate the process, it can be impossible for employees to commit to a time-consuming, vague process. Companies need to know the exact steps they need to take to solve their problems. This is exactly where a skilled Agile enterprise coach can step in. ● No relevance to company’s needs: Organizations may be facing daily issues that may appear as if they can’t be helped by a transformation. The solution here is to build a transformation strategy that remains linked to daily issues and business results, making the relevancy and association between the two clear. ● No focus on personal development: Some companies put the entire focus on professional development rather than personal development. The former is more likely to directly contribute to company performance, while the latter may not seem to have as immediate or visible results.  ● No shared vision: One challenge the leader may face is not being able to recognize that their personal vision may not be the same as the shared vision held by the organization.   Problems Addressed  Learning organizations were designed to address some of the biggest problems that halt company growth and overall success. Three of the most crucial are fragmentation, competition, and reactiveness.  Fragmentation: Fragmentation occurs when organizations break problems into pieces. This is a very common problem, evidenced by all the different departments typically found within a single company: accounting, IT, marketing, human resources, and others.  Competition: Outside competition is a given, but sometimes you’ll find an even fiercer version inside the company. Employees spend great amounts of energy and time trying to outdo their colleagues, rather than pooling their strengths through collaboration.

 Reactiveness: Reactiveness happens when companies only make changes as a reaction to outside forces, acting in defensiveness when cornered to do so. Learning organizations proactively initiate change.    Michael: It’s crucial to understand that a learning organization is always moving, but it’s moving in a way that perpetually increases their knowledge.  It’s not the same thing as constant firefighting. When you see firefighters in action, it looks like they’re doing a lot of stuff – but they’re not necessarily learning. They are repeating activities in which they’ve been trained and already know.   Learning is not the same as activity. It can encompass activity, provided the activity is expanding their knowledge or teaching them something new.   Creating a Culture of Learning  Learning organizations are those that value learning, and they make that value a part of their very culture. And making learning an active value in their culture goes far beyond mentioning it in a value statement written by management and pasted on their website.  These organizations will live, breathe, and perpetuate learning at every turn. You’ll see learning highlighted and practiced both implicitly and explicitly throughout the organization. Learning organizations spend massive amounts of time, both individually and in groups, increasing their knowledge and sharing ideas.  Not only will they spend time learning, but they will spend money on it. They have training budgets, putting money in the direction of ongoing learning for everyone within the organization.   You’ll also find leaders who don’t just talk the learning talk – they walk the learning walk. Leaders who fully embrace and exemplify the learning concept, serving as role models for the rest of the employees.   Michael: In learning organizations, leadership will constantly be sharing what they’re learning. They’ll pass along new information as they obtain it. They’ll say things like, “I’ve been reading this book,” or “I saw this Netflix documentary that I learned from.” They will explicitly say they value learning. They will freely pass along information, making it clear that learning is not something they simply talk about, but something they do on an ongoing basis.    A prime example of a learning organization is Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard platform designed for remote and distributed teams. Learning through collaboration is one of the most

effective ways to learn, and collaboration is a central theme in both the Miro company culture as well as its product.  One of the goals of its platform is “creating a space for shared understanding,” or a shared vision that’s an integral component of a learning organization. Not only does the company strive to help change the way the world collaborates to learn, but it implements many collaborative learning practices within its own organization.   Team members are consistently learning and evolving, with the company always striving to create a better version of itself. That value is one of the hallmarks of a learning organization.   Another key element in a learning organization is embracing failure. When you’re learning new things that have not yet been mastered or even tried, failure is bound to be part of the landscape. Rather than treating failure as a setback or something for which people need to be punished, it needs to be viewed as something from which people can learn.  If employees are fearful of the repercussions of failure, they will go out of their way to avoid it. They’ll become unwilling to share new ideas or try new approaches. They will, in effect, be shutting down the idea of learning before it can even begin.   Examples  There are many ways to begin incorporating a culture of learning into an organization, and we’re sharing several examples below. The examples start with learning on a one-to-one basis and expand to get more people and even the entire company involved.  As with all the examples we outline in this book, you’re not obligated to use any of them in your practice. They are merely offered up to illustrate tactics and strategies that have worked to help companies develop a culture of learning within their own organizations.   Just because a company is using any of these practices doesn’t mean they are automatically a learning organization. And just because they don’t doesn’t mean they aren’t. The examples are here for your reference and knowledge.   Learning How to Learn: Creativity Traffic Jam  This involves learning about what it takes for you to be creative. The idea is to identify when a creativity traffic jam is occurring, or an environment that is not creative. Non-creative environments may contain lots of criticism, along with a lack of time and space for creativity. Break through the creativity traffic jam, and you can accelerate into the learning zone.  Cherie: I’m not certain where the original concept generated for Rubber Duck Productivity because there are many articles floating around on the topic. However, this is a brilliant technique that a team I was coaching used to break the creativity traffic jam. Rubber Duck

Productivity was an experiment where people found that they were more productive when they kept a rubber duck on their desk.  When they encountered a problem, they were having trouble solving they would talk to the duck and tell the duck the problem. In the process of explaining the problem to the duck they would usually discover the solution. Thus, being more productive than just trying to solve problems in the reaches of their own mind.   15-Minute Rapid Feedback on New Work  Feedback can be crucial to learning, providing insights on whether new ideas are working. This can be done by providing employees with a company contact that can take 15 minutes to review and provide feedback on new work.   Cherie: I was able to introduce this technique to a company I was working with as a project manager, and it was very effective. I was managing a project (yep - before my agile experience and the company was not doing agile in any way) and the internal customer group that we were building a website for kept changing the requirements. That wasn’t the problem. The problem was that each time they wanted to change something, all work halted while they spent days revising wire frames and requirements documents. I was seeing how much time was being wasted and asked if we could try something different. I told them that I would take total blame if it didn’t work or if we got reprimanded. I suggested that we just stop all the documentation. I invited them to come sit down next to the development team once a day for a few minutes and look at what they were producing, make change suggestions, and let them implement changes while they were sitting there. I told them once the website was built, we could generate a matching wireframe and requirements documents to satisfy the PMO requirements. It worked beautifully. After that, I ran all my projects this way and the funniest part of the whole experience was that the PMO always praised me as being the best project manager in the company because my documentation was always spot on.   Pairing  Just as it sounds, pairing, which is an eXtreme Programming concept, refers to two people working on the same thing at the same time. It can be applied to coding, design – anything. In the case of coding, one person could talk while the other codes, and the two could switch roles as needed or desired.  Pairing was key to catapulting Google into a household name (and changing the course of the internet). It all started when computer scientists Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat22 sat down to code together at the same computer.  “I don’t know why more people don’t do it,” Ghemawat said of programming with a partner.  22  https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge

 Dean offered a tip for making the pairing a monumental success. “You need to find someone that you’re going to pair-program with who’s compatible with your way of thinking, so that the two of you together are a complementary force.”  Developmental Relationships  Development relationships refer to relationships in which two people get together to pair, pushing each other to reach higher and higher heights. Michael de la Maza developed this concept, based upon the concepts in the book Developmental Organizations.23 Developmental Relationships are a highly effective way for two people to work together to support each other’s personal growth.   Characteristics of a developmental relationship include: ● Warmth: The people in a developmental relationship genuinely enjoy spending time with each other. ● Transparency: The ability to communicate and collaborate with genuine candor.  ● Witnessing: The ability to connect without judgement. ● Discomfort: Because both people are constantly focused on edges. ● Rapid personal development: Because the developmental partner allows you to see edges that you do not see.  Some keys for building and maintaining a developmental relationship include:  ● Being yourself: Try introspection, meditation, and other self-reflection tools.  ● Nurturing each other: Care for and encourage the growth and development of each other. ● Lifting each other up: Try listening, awareness, wisdom. ● Crushing it: What’s possible now?  Additional information on developmental relationships can be found in this video24, which goes into more details on how they can result in greater and greater levels of success.  Developing Peer Mentorships  Mentoring has many different structures and can look many ways. Often when people think of having a mentor, they think of a professional arrangement with someone in their chosen field. This arrangement might be a paid contracted relationship, it might be in the confines of a program in the workplace, or some other formal arrangement.

Cherie, for example, has lots of formal mentoring relationships with Agile coaches. She often does mentor groups and accepts a few formal mentoring contracts each year with high potential coaches who are invested in doing whatever it takes to become great Agile coaches. These are formal relationships where the people Cherie mentors are committed to making an investment in their own careers. They make a time and financial commitment and take on the responsibility for their own development. Cherie partners with them for a year to give them guidance, feedback, and helps them to develop their confidence, competence, and skills as Agile coaches.   People can get certified as professional mentors in a domain in which they have expertise, whether it’s software, design, leadership, or another area. Cherie and Alex, for example, are both certified as Mentor Coaches for people who are aspiring to become credentialed with ICF as ACC, PCC, or MCC coaches. They often tag-team and both work with a mentee giving them insightful feedback on their coaching competency and helping them to develop high levels of competence.   A mentoring relationship can also be informal. Agile coaches often mentor scrum masters, product owners, managers while on coaching engagements. Sometimes managers and leaders are mentors in the development of those they lead. You might even have a relative who you view as a mentor or a public figure who you follow and even if they don’t realize it, they are a mentor to you. A great example of someone who has thousands of mentees she has never met is Lyssa Adkins. People watch her videos and read her books and she inspires them. She serves as a role model for many scrum masters and agile coaches she has never met.  One of your greatest superpowers for creating a sustainable environment of growth and change in an organization is to work with them to develop mentoring as a part of the structure and fiber of the way the company continuously learns and improves.  The only qualifications needed to be a mentor to another person is that you are a bit farther down the road than they are and that you are willing to share what you know with them to become successful in that area. People who are lower in the ranks of a company can certainly mentor higher ranking employees if they have more expertise in the area the higher-ranking employee wants to learn about. It’s not about hierarchy. It’s about learning and sharing knowledge. Mentoring helps both people grow and can be done through peer relationships.   Cherie: Almost every person who has been a mentor to me over the years has been a peer whom I worked with. They taught me and I taught them. I was willing to share my knowledge and professional opinions with them and they were willing to do the same. We both learned. We both challenged each other’s thoughts and ideas. And we both grew from the experience. Some of the peers who have mentored me have been much younger with less experience in the professional world. One example is Allison Pollard25 who partnered with me to develop ideas for the work we did in enterprise coaching, developed conference talks, and learned to work the conference circuit, and went on the journey of professional coaching together. I was humble  25  https://www.linkedin.com/in/allisonpollard/

enough to learn from her and she was humble enough to learn from me. We grew together, as peers. An example of a time when I had a complementary mentoring relationship with someone above me in the organization was when I worked with Ross Hughes.26 He was my boss at a full-time employee engagement, and he learned as much from me as I learned from him. Rather than worrying about appearances and having to “be the boss,” Ross was open to listening to ideas from my experience and specific training that he didn’t have. He was also willing to share his experience with me. It was a great growth experience for both of us and I believe we both became more confident in our ability to make an impact.  Cherie has partnered with clients to help them develop mentoring programs that fit into their culture. As an example, some programs pull experienced scrum masters who were developing as agile coaches from one division to work developing scrum masters in a different division. A program like this enables both scrum masters to grow and develop the talent they want to cultivate and creates a growth path that is not dependent on the Agile coach. It also enables you as an agile coach to train coaches that are employees of the company to coach other teams and scrum masters so the company will be equipped with the coaching competency they need when your engagement with them is complete.   Creating a Feedback Culture  When managers provide feedback, it’s often during a performance review. It’s also often tied to whether an employee will get a promotion or bonus. Decoupling the feedback from the performance review allows feedback to be given in a way that’s not tied to your overall job status or security. It removes the worry, fear and judgement that are attached to traditional feedback. This provides an environment that’s conducive to learning.  As an Agile coach working with organizations, you are in a great position to influence the way feedback is given and received. Many of the traditional ways of getting and receiving feedback create a culture filled with defensiveness and fear rather than a culture that values growth and vulnerability.   Cherie: Bob Small,27 whom I worked with in 2016-2017, had a wonderful outlook on feedback. He views feedback as a gift. He is one of the few people I’ve known that often came to me after an interaction and asked, “Do you have any feedback you can share about my interactions during that session?” It was refreshing to see someone who wasn’t afraid of the “F word” even though it is often used as a weapon by people who want to share unsolicited opinions. Bob was a model for how feedback can be embraced and following his lead, others in the organization began to be more comfortable asking for feedback. It also gave Bob lots of credibility as a coach because he proved that he was listening to his clients and colleagues and constantly looking to

improve. His vulnerability sent a message that he didn’t believe himself superior to anyone and it gave others the freedom to exercise their own vulnerability and humility to grow.  One of the traditional and damaging ways of giving and receiving feedback is through anonymous 360 feedback programs or anonymous surveys. When an anonymous survey is collected at the organizational level and not targeted at individuals it can be a great way to gauge trends. To gauge trends, the feedback has to be collected on a consistent cadence and in the same manner each time. A baseline survey can tell the organization where the starting point is. Each time the survey is repeated, sometimes quarterly or semi-annually, there is another data point on a trend line. After 4-5 collections of data trends become a bit clearer. However, if the organizational leaders are not using the data collected to make changes, the data collection is worthless. Also, if the data is being used as a whipping stick or performance management tool or sliced too thinly to be able to target small groups of people or individual managers it also becomes useless.  Cherie shares, “My opinion is that anonymous 360 feedback creates more harm than good. I hate it and always recommend against it for individuals. Organizations and individuals often use anonymity to create psychological safety to get honest feedback. The first problem with this is that they are treating the symptoms of the real problem. Instead of going around the problem, address the reality that the organization does not have enough psychological safety for people to believe they can give feedback honestly. And if they do, by requesting anonymous feedback you are suggesting that they shouldn’t.  I have never experienced receiving anonymous feedback that was helpful. Either the feedback was fluffy and told me what I already knew, or it told me things I didn’t know and left me frustrated because I didn’t know what to do with it. I had no way to ask questions to understand more so I could understand the changes that would be helpful to make. I just had to guess what the feedback meant and that wasn’t helpful at all. In fact, it created defensiveness because whoever gave the feedback didn’t tell me directly that I was doing something wrong. If you’re honest, you’ve likely had this same reaction. It’s also likely that after receiving this kind of feedback you spent at least a few days trying to figure out who said it. This creates a barrier to psychological safety. In my opinion this is using feedback as a weapon instead of using it as a gift.  I make it my standard practice to refuse anonymous feedback. It isn’t helpful and I can’t do anything with it so it’s not worth being stressed over it. I don’t give feedback to anyone on any survey that I have not already said to them directly. And, if I fill in the form, I make it clear that the feedback is coming from me and if they want to talk about it further, they are invited to speak to me. I believe that it is unfair to expect people to contribute 360 feedback to a peer’s performance review. It’s an enormous waste of time to have twenty 360 requests to fill in. No one in their right mind sends a 360 request for a performance review to people whom they know will rate them poorly. Most of the time the feedback is not valuable because no one wants to say something that might hurt a peers performance review. There’s definitely better ways to get feedback.”

 Part of the goal of coaching is to help the client organization develop a culture of collaboration and learning. What better way to do this than to help them learn to give and receive feedback as a standard way of working. Anonymous feedback doesn’t create psychological safety, but openness and respect do. When working with teams of people, establish working agreements that include how they will give and receive feedback. Teach them techniques that are effective for giving and receiving feedback. Here are a few ideas to get you started:  ● Impact Feedback using SBI28 method - This method can be very effective as a conversation starter for feedback. The key to making it effective is to have them practice the method utilizing positive feedback. People tend to think feedback is only for constructive criticism. It’s not. When you practice giving feedback on things you see people doing right it makes it much easier to use that same pattern to give constructive feedback. ● Feedback Circles: This technique developed by Cherie can be used during retrospectives, Community of Practice sessions, or other meetings where people are there to learn and grow. Have people get in groups and give feedback to one another. Each person gives an observation of something good they have experienced with the other person since the last time they met. Then, they give the person an observation of something they can do more effectively with an idea of how it might be improved. The point of the circles isn’t to focus on criticism, but to focus on being more comfortable giving and receiving feedback as a gift. Each person leaves the circle with one thing they were “caught” doing well since the last circle and one thing they can choose to work on until the next circle. These circles can be effective for creating a collaborative learning environment that is open to giving and receiving feedback as a gift rather than as discipline. Doing feedback circles at least once a month gives people time in between to work on improvements. They also have the opportunity in the next feedback circle to ask for feedback on improvements they are focusing on since the last circle.  Performance management in an organization can be a tough battle. Most organizations have performance management and merit rewards that are focused on 1-1 performance even though people are working in teams. This can reduce the effectiveness of the team because everyone needs to protect their own performance rating. When you see this happening in an organization you can work with the leaders to develop different ways to measure performance. There will likely always be some portion of performance that ties back to an individual. However, if the team has shared goals that the whole team is rated on, they have a common reason to perform at their very best rather than either being a superhero or a saboteur.   Cherie worked with one organizational leader in 2014, Dan Afseth,29 who ran multiple experiments in his organization that put performance management into the hands of the agile teams. He sent them on a mission to figure out the best way to do performance management in  28  https://www.the10minuteleader.com/how-to-give-good-feedback/  29  https://www.linkedin.com/in/danafseth/

the organization as self-organized teams. There were only two stipulations, first, they had to have a method in place for all team members to get feedback from the rest of the team a minimum of once a month. Second, they had to have team focused goals that all were going to be accountable for delivering on and those goals had to be in support of the organizational goals. He ran the experiment for an initial period of 3 months at the end of which they would come together and describe the processes they developed and what worked or what didn’t work. Then, they would decide if they should continue the experiment for another 3 months before deciding how they would proceed forward. [note: cherie has a bit more to add here after speaking with Dan]   Bite-Sized Learning  Bite-sized learning is gaining widespread popularity as a learning tool. It involves serving up information in bite-sized chunks, with one to three-minute lessons people can access at their convenience. Employees no longer need to sit in a class for hours on end. They can instead learn smaller bits of information on demand. Many learning organizations make these mini-lessons available inside the company, with kiosks, apps or other tools employees can use to get their lesson of the moment. By making these lessons available on the company intranet you can help the company build sustainability and also scale yourself as an agile coach because people can be redirected to learn from you in a more permanent place, they will have access to after you leave.    Internal University  Another element you can leverage in helping clients develop into learning organizations is an internal university. This consists of a university inside a company that develops training for employees. You may find human resource training, onboarding training, software how-to training, or training on how to do sales. The overall goal is to make employees in the company smarter about doing their jobs.   Cherie has worked with a few of her clients to create an Agile University inside their company designed to develop an entire learning path for those who want to embrace and incorporate the Agile principles into their work. It provides a growth path for agilists to further their careers and provides the organization with a stream of agile coaches they can select from internally when positions open up. The more learning and growth the client can complete on their own, the more sustainable the changes they make in agility will become.  Internal Open Space30  Another way to promote learning is with internal open space events. Here attendees collaborate on creating the agenda for the event, and then select the topics they want to attend. Open  30  https://openspaceworld.org/wp2/what-is/

space can be a great learning experience for internal organizations to discuss improvements, impediments, or any other focus topic. Open space events can be as short as a couple of hours or full day events. They are great ways to get people from different parts of the organization to share ideas and experiences.  Internal Conferences  Internal conferences involve a standard agenda and a more traditional take on a learning event. But that doesn’t make them any less useful. Many companies hold them on an annual basis. This can be a great way to develop the next set of agile leaders who will be taking the reins of the agile adoption work forward after the coach has disengaged. Internal conferences set the stage for multiple people to be seen as subject matter experts who can be called upon when needed. It also enables teams to share experiences with others who can learn from them.  Cherie: One client I worked with had a group of scrum masters who set up semi-annual internal conferences that had tracks for individuals to present learning topics, a track with teams sharing experiments they did that worked and didn’t work for others to learn. There was also a track for technical talks so teams could share new techniques they adopted and taught others how to use them. One the opposite semi-annual cycle, the company conducted Hackathon events. So, each quarter there was an investment into innovation and growth.  Hackathon  A hackathon is a learning event where employees set aside a day or two to focus on innovation. They can develop anything they want; it doesn’t have to be tied to the company goals or previously discussed ideas. The event can be held for a day or over the course of several days or week, providing an environment open to massive exploration. Usually, at the end of the hackathon there is some sort of show and tell where people share their prototypes, improvements, and experiments with others so the whole organization gets to benefit from that learning. In some companies the product leaders have a “shark tank” where people can pitch their ideas and show their prototypes to the product leaders. If their ideas are adopted, they get funding to work in an incubator lab for a year with a full team developing the product and testing it in the market. If the incubator produces good results, the product is picked up by the company.   Internal Knowledge Creation: Proprietary Assets    Companies can expand their knowledge through the creation of proprietary assets. These assets are generated and owned exclusively by the company, and they’re free to share them with others – or not.   Proprietary assets can give you an edge over the competition as well as a way of looking at and understanding things through the specific mental models created by the company.

Organizations can share knowledge through blogs, videos and experience reports accessible through the companywide intranet.   Community of Practice, Mastermind Groups A community of practice refers to a group of people that share a common activity or interest who regularly get together to learn how to improve that activity or deepen their knowledge of that interest. One key to a great CoP is that it is intended to be a place where you can learn new skills and practice them in a safe environment. A great way to build sustainable growth into the company you are working with is to develop communities of practice. Depending on the size of the company and the interest you might build one agile CoP or several that are sorted by role type. Getting a community of practice started is easy - developing it to remain stable when you are no longer involved takes a bit longer. Some common steps for developing sustainability into your CoP are: ● Get it started! At first you may need to gather people, build a backlog of topics they want to learn more about. Depending on the organization you may have to lead several sessions to get it started. This might mean that you are the one in the spotlight for 4-6 months if they have sessions once a month. You might even have to organize the sessions at first. However, it is recommended that you have a person who is an FTE take ownership of that.  ● The next step is to work with people to help them develop sessions. You might need to partner with them as they deliver their first session then set them off on their own. Sometimes you will need to partner with someone to learn the skills or gain the knowledge in an area of interest. Then partner with them to put together a session to present. After several months of working with several individuals to start presenting you can ask those people to partner with new people who are willing to learn and share their learnings with the group. They don’t have to be experts. They just must be willing to open a conversation and talk about what they know and listen to others share their own ideas so the group can learn together. ● If you have not already done so, the next step is to hand over the organization of the CoP to the community. Solicit a team of volunteers who will run the CoP and make sure it’s scheduled and there are people to present every month. ● Once they take over the presenting and the organization, you can back out gracefully and watch the CoP run without your involvement. Check in every once in a while, just to see how they’re doing and ensure that it is self-sufficient, and you’ll be pleased to see sustainability in action.  Mastermind groups are similar, with like-minded individuals meeting on a regular basis to brainstorm, share knowledge and support each on the road to success.   Each person in the group might share about a particular topic for a few minutes, providing useful information they’ve learned or used in their own practice. When people learn what others are doing to achieve success, they tend to learn faster. There is generally an opportunity for someone to sit in the “hot seat” for a few minutes and share a challenge they are having and get coaching or mentoring from the rest of the group. That individual gets more information about

how to handle their challenge and others learn ways to deal with similar challenges they may encounter.   Community of practice and mastermind groups can be used at different levels throughout the organization, each focused on targeted areas of common interest.   Cherie: I’ve noticed that managers tend to like the concept of a mastermind group more than CoP group. If they are learning I’m happy to help them get started in any format they wish. I’ve also noticed that some companies prefer to run the CoP as Lean Coffee events so everyone brings topics, and the group gets to touch on multiple topics rather than have a single topic for an hour.  Summing It Up  A learning organization has the capacity to consistently gain and incorporate new knowledge. Yet the transformation into becoming one is not going to happen automatically. It takes a lot of hard work, the ability to overcome obstacles and a willingness to change. All that hard work, however, can pay off by producing a company that continuously evolves into the very best version of itself.

Chapter 21: Promoting Psychological Safety  Psychological Safety It happens in every profession in every industry. An employee may notice something is about to go wrong with something in the organization – but doesn’t speak up or do anything to stop it. Why not?   There could be a whole host of reasons. The person may be too scared to speak up. Maybe every thought or idea they’ve brought up before got shot down. Perhaps their boss had chided them in the past for “talking about things they know nothing about.” The person could fear feeling like an idiot – or being called one – if they say something and they’re wrong. Or maybe the employee is so fed up and full of contempt for the company that they are secretly elated that something horrible is about to happen to bring it down. All those scenarios, and many others, can stem from the lack of a crucial element in the workplace: psychological safety. This chapter provides a thorough rundown of what psychological safety is and its extreme importance in the team environment. In this chapter, we’ll also give a few techniques you can use to build psychological safety with clients in your enterprise coaching practice and describe some communication patterns well-known for destroying it. What It Is The concept of “team psychological safety” was first introduced by Harvard organization behavioral scientist Amy Edmondson31. She defines it as: “A shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.” To elaborate on this, psychological safety is the belief that the environment is safe for taking an interpersonal risk without being seen as negative, disruptive, incompetent, or ignorant. Team members feel they can ask questions, offer suggestions, admit mistakes, and otherwise be vulnerable in front of each other without being disparaged, embarrassed, or punished. Michael says: Let’s say you have a team project, yet one team member is unclear on the project’s goal or his exact role in the undertaking. If he’s on a team with high levels of psychological safety, he’ll feel safe enough to ask those questions without fear of being made to feel foolish.

If he’s on a team that lacks psychological safety, he may decide to remain silent, not asking any questions. He might feel it’s easier to simply play along and hope for the best without a firm understanding just so he won’t be looked at as being ignorant. Team members may be more worried about being perceived as ignorant than they are about messing up the work because they do not fully understand what’s going on. Michael’s example illustrates how lack of psychological safety can create huge problems in the output of the team. When Google researchers32 set out to discover what makes a team effective at Google, they found the most important factor was not who was on the team but how a team worked together. The research, entitled “Project Aristotle,” looked at how team composition and team dynamics impacted the effectiveness of the 180 different teams targeted for study. Researchers conducted hundreds of interviews with leaders, reviewed existing survey data from the annual Google employee engagement survey, and ran more than 35 statistical models on hundreds of variables to discover what made exceptional teams click. They boiled it all down to discover the five key dynamics of effective teams. Psychological safety was the foundational element. It precedes dependability, team structure and clarity, meaningful work, and impactful work. The research also found that employees on teams with higher psychological safety levels: ● Were less likely to leave the company ● Were more likely to be open to diverse ideas from other team members ● Brought in more revenue ● Were rated as effective by executives twice as often as employees on teams with a low-level of psychological safety What Psychological Safety Looks Like If you were to give team members a list of team attributes that comes with psychological safety, it would look something like this: ● Making a mistake is not held against you ● You’re able to bring up tough issues and problems ● No one is rejected for being or thinking differently ● Diverse opinions are embraced ● It’s okay and even encouraged to disagree ● Opinions are respected ● Questions are encouraged ● You feel safe to take a risk ● Failure is seen as helpful for learning  32  https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/

●  It’s easy to ask other team members for help ● No other team member purposely behaves in a way that undermines your efforts ●  Your unique skills and talents are both used and valued working with other team members  How to Build Psychological Safety It would be great if you could just hand managers and team members the list of what psychological safety looks like and tell them to go for it. But it doesn’t work that way. Building this element with a team is possible through strategic techniques and concerted efforts. Here are several for consideration. 1. Three Techniques from Edmondson Edmondson discusses three techniques for building psychological safety in her TEDx talk33: Frame the work as a learning problem, not an execution problem. Recognize that both uncertainty and interdependence exist. Say something like, “We’ve never been in this territory before, and we need to have everyone’s input.” Acknowledge your fallibility. This applies to all team members at all levels, from subordinates to peers and colleagues. Say something like, “I may miss something, and I need to hear from you to make sure I don’t.” This creates more safety for speaking. Model curiosity and ask lots of questions. When people with positional authority ask questions, team members are more likely to speak up and answer. Two Tips for Leaders   Leaders and managers can contribute to building psychological safety by using these two suggestions that came out of Google research. ● Solicit input and opinions from the group. Like Edmonton’s suggestion to model curiosity and ask lots of questions, directly asking team members for input opens the doors for people to speak up. ●  Share information about personal and work style preferences and encourage others to do the same. Disclosing information about yourself reveals a layer of vulnerability which is a key component of psychological safety. 2. The VAST Cycle

Another way to build psychological safety within an organization is to show up in a way that invites people to connect, trust, and feel safe. A tool that can help you increase this type of engagement is the VAST cycle34. Developed by Michael Sahota and Olaf Lewitz, the VAST cycle is an acronym that stands for: ● Vulnerability ● Authentic Connection ● Safety ● Trust It’s an incredible way to build awareness and choice for organizations, particularly when it’s contrasted with a fearful and mistrusting way of being. Keeping the cycle top of mind can help guide behavior as well as create ideas for experiments. The VAST cycle can be used for organizations and individuals in both professional and personal contexts. One way to use VAST is as a tool for introspection. Team members can be encouraged to ask themselves: ● How trusting am I? ● How safe do I feel? ● How connected do I feel? ● How vulnerable am I choosing to be? ● How authentically am I acting? Once individuals answer those questions for themselves, they can use the VAST model to adapt their behavior accordingly. For example: ● I can choose to trust the other person and notice how my behavior changes. ● I can choose to be vulnerable and share how I feel. How I am feeling unsafe. How I am not trusting. ●  I can state what I want. “I want to restart this conversation. I want to focus on how we can support each other. I want to focus on the goal.” ● I can ask for help. Michael: In my experience, vulnerability is a powerful way to create psychological safety. Owning our experience. Owning how we feel. And then sharing it with others. It kicks off the entire VAST cycle, opening the door for authentic connections with safety and trust to follow. Cherie: In my experience, I have noticed that vulnerability gives other people hope and makes them feel like they can accomplish anything. Many leaders believe that to be seen as a leader they need to project an image that says, “I’m perfect. I never make mistakes. I know everything.” But this image doesn’t help other people. That belief only serves to make the leader feel more confident that other people see a superhero in them. But when people see how “perfect” we are  34  https://shift314.com/vast-connection-cycle/

it more often causes tension and a feeling that they are not good enough. What makes people feel like you are someone they can look up to as a role model is when you can say, “Here are the mistakes I have made along the way and what I have learned from them.” or “I’m struggling with this thing. I don’t know all the answers and I could use some perspectives from you.” When people who work with us see our vulnerabilities, it makes us more human. When they see the things, we have accomplished and are made aware of our imperfections, they start to believe that they are also capable of accomplishing great things. Trust is one of the components in the VAST cycle; it’s also a key for psychological safety in any relationship. University of Houston research professor Brené Brown35 uses the acronym BRAVING to outline specific elements that need to exist for trust to be present. 3. BRAVING: The Seven Elements of Trust  Boundaries: You respect my boundaries, and when you’re not clear about what’s OK and not OK, you ask. You’re willing to say no. Reliability: You do what you say you’ll do. At work, this means staying aware of your competencies and limitations so you don’t over promise and can deliver on commitments and balance competing priorities. Accountability: You own your mistakes, apologize, and make amends. Vault: You don’t share information or experiences that are not yours to share. I need to know that my confidences are kept and that you’re not sharing with me any information about other people that should be confidential. Integrity: You choose courage over comfort. You choose what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy. And you choose to practice your values rather than simply professing them. Non-Judgment: I can ask for what I need, and you can ask for what you need. We can talk about how we feel without judgment. Generosity: You extend the most generous interpretation possible to the intentions, words, and actions of others. How Psychological Safety Gets Destroyed In a psychologically safe environment, team members communicate with each other openly, honestly, and with a level of vulnerability that encourages authentic connections, safety, and trust. But that environment can be destroyed rather quickly when unhealthy, unproductive communication patterns arise.

The Gottman Institute, which brings a research-based approach to relationships, identifies four of these patterns, dubbing them the Four Horsemen36. Just as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse depicted the end of times, these Four Horsemen of communication styles can predict the end of relationships: ● Criticism or Blaming ● Contempt ● Defensiveness ● Stonewalling While the Gottman Institute focuses mainly on family relationships, these four elements can likewise spell doom and gloom for relationships within organizations, annihilating any sense of psychological safety. Cherie refers to these four elements as Toxic Communication Strategies. By introducing healthy communication strategies to counteract these toxic strategies we can help team members learn to both intervene in their tendency to turn to a Toxic Communication Strategy and de-escalate a conflict when someone else is utilizing a Toxic Communication Strategy.   It is helpful to remember that just because someone utilizes a Toxic Communication Strategy it doesn’t mean that they are a toxic person or even a bad person. Everyone utilizes these strategies at some point and we all generally have a favorite “go to” strategy we run to when we feel threatened, angry, or some other negative emotion. These are learned strategies that often start in childhood. For example, think of a small child who is trying to play with a toy that isn’t working. They get frustrated, bang the part on the toy, and cry. The parent comes and helps them. Then at age five, he wants a cookie. The parent says, “no,” and the child gets frustrated and throws a tantrum. The parent is busy and tired and just gives in and gives the child a cookie. Then, a few years later as a teen, the child wants to go somewhere with friends and the parent says, “No, we have other plans.” The child throws a tantrum, and the parent gives in. This behavior is repeated throughout childhood and into adulthood and the child has learned that by getting angry and throwing tantrums they can get what they want. In the workplace, when they don’t get what they want they throw similar tantrums and thus… Toxic Communication Strategies show up on the team.  Think about your natural tendency when you don’t get your way or when someone tells you something you don’t agree with. Do you get a bit defensive? Do you blame someone else for the problem or start domineering to bully them into submission? Do you shut down and hold your anger inside but give the silent treatment? Do you walk away and tell someone how horrible the other person is or roll your eyes and say, “whatever”? When we can identify our natural tendencies, we can be vulnerable and help our team members understand that these are normal human behaviors. However, they are hurtful behaviors that destroy psychological safety in our relationships.  36  https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-recognizing-criticism-contempt-defensiveness-and-stonewalling/

When educating your clients on these toxins, it is often helpful to have them identify the toxin that is their personal “go to” which normalizes the strategies. Then, explore together how the team as an intact system reacts to conflict. Which toxic strategies do they most often fall into? Do they tend to stonewall? Do they tend to blame someone outside the team for the challenges they are having? Once they identify some of the “go to” strategies of the team ask these questions:  ● What situations bring out these toxins in the team? ● How do we behave when we are utilizing these toxins? ● What is the belief behind the toxins? ● How are these toxins trying to be helpful? Once the team members understand how these Toxic Communication Strategies work and can identify behaviors associated with them it is helpful to introduce healthy communication strategies that can counteract the toxins. Criticism and Blame The person giving the criticism may believe on some level they are trying to be helpful by offering a suggestion, but their delivery method turns it into an attack. Cherie views both blame and criticism as offensive actions. Complaining is different from criticism because criticism attacks the person where complaints focus on a specific behavior. Variations of criticism and blame can include: ● Aggressive attack: An obvious verbal assault ● Bullying: Attempting to coerce through intimidation ● Harsh startup: Beginning a conversation with blame, criticism, or attack ● Chronic criticalness: Perpetually adding negative words about a character or personality ● Domination: Attempting to control or influence through intimidation ● Criticism: complaining about a person instead of addressing behavior directly Healthy strategies that can combat criticism and blame 1. It is helpful to understand that while it may be hurtful, criticism is an unskillful attempt at giving useful feedback. When we can remember that the person has some useful information they are trying to relay, we are often able to separate the delivery of the feedback from the feedback itself and receive it without turning to defensiveness to protect ourselves from the perceived attack. 2. It is also helpful to identify your contribution to the problem. We are often so focused on what others are doing (blaming) that we don’t take ownership of how we are partly responsible for what is happening.  ○ Example: I am frustrated because a team member is always late for our meetings ○ My contribution: I insisted that the meeting is first thing in the morning because that was convenient for me. I didn’t take into consideration that they have

children to get to school and a long commute that sometimes gets delayed by traffic. 3. When you feel frustrated by the actions of others, stop yourself from criticizing by thinking through your complaint. Focus on specific behavior; don’t attack the person's character ● No: You’re so irresponsible ● Yes: It hinders the team’s productivity when you are late 4. Turn the complaint into a request. Instead of complaining about the behavior, you do not want, ask for the behavior you want. ●  No: You’re always late ● Yes: Can you email us your updates when you are going to be late so we will know how to get started on the work? 5. When someone is complaining to you, you can turn the complaint into a request by asking a question like these: ● Can you tell us what you want to happen instead? ● What would you like to request us to do differently? 6. Rather than focusing on individuals and the actions of individuals or your frustration, focus on “What does the relationship need from us now?” ● No: Everyone else is always on time.  ● Yes: What can we do to promote everyone’s ability to be at meetings on time regularly? Defensiveness Defensiveness escalates conflict and is the most recognized Toxic Communication Strategy. Cherie views defensiveness as reactive blaming. It’s a defense mechanism to deflect blame from oneself to others. Rather than accepting or admitting a mistake, defensiveness turns the tables to imply, “It’s not me. It’s you.” Variations can include: ● Not being open to influence ● Refusal to take responsibility ● Deflection ● “Not my fault, not my job” mindset Healthy strategies that can combat defensiveness Blaming often occurs when we get triggered by the actions or words of others (often through one of the other Toxic Communication Strategies).  1. When you feel triggered by what someone else has said, rather than jumping into defensiveness, breathe. Repeat what you believe you heard them say and ask for clarification ● No: I did NOT press the wrong button to disconnect the call. ● No: So, you’re saying I hit a button that disconnected the call? Which button was that?

176 
● Yes: It seems like you are saying I disconnected the call, possibly on purpose. Is this what you intended to say? 2. Similarly, when you sense that someone else is triggered and they are getting defensive in response to what you have said or done, ask them to tell you the message they believe you were sending; clarify ● No: What’s your problem? ● Yes: I’m sorry, it seems like what I said may not have come across as intended. What message do you believe I was trying to convey? (Clarify as needed) 3. Similarly, when you feel triggered, you can give the other person the benefit of doubt by taking the posture that you may have misunderstood their message or motive:  ● Yes: I’m not sure I understand what you’re saying. Can you clarify what you believe went wrong? 4. Another helpful strategy is to listen beyond the words. Instead of looking at the disagreement point, remember that there is an intention of giving some useful feedback. Even if the complaint is not being communicated skillfully, there is probably some truth in it that your defensive reaction is causing you to overlook. Search for the element of truth in what you are hearing: ● No: So, what if the phone system is new; I don’t need classes to figure it out. ● Yes: This is a new phone system.  It is possible that I hit the wrong button in error and hung up.  Stonewalling Stonewalling feeds other toxins. Stonewalling is cutting off communication. This can be done via silent treatments, refusal to engage, withdrawal, or reluctance to directly communicate. Stonewalling can be overt like refusing to speak to someone when they talk to you. Only answering with short words in a sarcastic tone, etc. And it can be covert such as not giving your ideas or not speaking up when you have an idea that could solve a problem. In essence, it’s disengaging as a self-protective measure. Sometimes people go into stonewalling when they are getting angry because they are using it as a shut off valve to control their anger. They figure better to shut down than to blow up. Both reactions can be equally toxic. Variations can include: ● Not being open to influence ● Avoidance ● Uncooperativeness ● Passivity or passive aggressive behaviors ● Disengagement ● Withholding information ● Silent Treatment

Healthy strategies that can combat stonewalling It’s often hard to recognize if someone else gets triggered and starts slipping into stonewalling behaviors quietly. But you can recognize when you are getting triggered and develop strategies to respond. First, it is important to understand the things that trigger you to shut down. Anger, fear, frustration, confusion, feeling threatened, being overwhelmed and other similar things may trigger you to start shutting down. When this happens, notice what happens in your mind and body. Do you feel tightness in your throat or chest? Does your mind start racing? Do you start shaking inside? Do you start to clench your teeth or fist? Perhaps you get a hopeless feeling? 1. By recognizing what it feels like to go into this triggered state of mind you can utilize this information to shift your natural tendencies to shut down. Develop a habit that counteracts the shutdown. Some people have found these helpful: ● Take a deep breath and release it slowly ● Take a drink of water or step out to get a drink of water. Walking releases the tension building up. Stepping away from the situation gives you time to compose your thoughts. Changing the perspective using moving to a different space can change your perspective ● Ask to take a break and resume the discussion at a specific time. (15 minutes, tomorrow at 3 pm) But don’t leave this open-ended - by not setting a specific timeframe on the pause you are likely to go deeper into stonewalling by hiding from the interaction. 2. Find a way to shift your perspective of what is happening  ●  No: They don’t like my ideas – fine! I won’t offer any ever again. ● Yes: This isn’t personal. We are all throwing thoughts into the pool so we can develop an idea together. All ideas are helpful. Once anyone releases an idea into the team space the team gets to own them and decide what to do with them. We are all just throwing thoughts in to see what other ideas we can provoke and build on. 3. Recognize that every voice is important and holds critical information for the team. ●  No: They only want to hear the best ideas that are guaranteed to work. ● Yes: We need to hear ALL the ideas. We can make the best decisions when we have input from everyone. Someone needs to shoot holes in all ideas to counteract the risk we don’t see when we think we have a great idea. 4. Design safety conditions that will allow everyone to speak up in meetings. Design working agreements with the team around how conflict is handled and what people need to feel safe enough to contribute.  ● No: Who wants to go first? ● Yes: Let’s go around the table, with each person sharing their ideas. If you don’t want to share, feel free to just say pass and we’ll respect that and keep going. If you change your mind later and want to jump in after you’ve already passed, please do so.

5. Evaluate if other toxic behaviors are impacting safe communication. What Toxic Communication Strategies are the team using regularly? Teach the team about these strategies and healthy ways of communicating that can be more productive. ● No: Asking the group “Why are you all so quiet? Don’t you have any brainpower?” ● Yes: Speaking with individual members privately, asking if there is anything you can do to help them feel more comfortable sharing their ideas. Contempt Contempt is fueled by long-simmering negative thoughts. It conveys disgust and condescension. It’s frequently the result of ongoing disdain, whether it’s disdain for an individual, a group, an institution, or the world in general. Variations can include: ● Sarcasm and hostile humor ● Personal attacks, including belittling and name-calling ● Cynicism ● Disrespectful gossip ● Demeaning tone ● Belligerence ● Eye-rolling     Healthy strategies that can combat contempt 1. Contempt in a team can be extremely damaging. One way to combat bringing contempt into a conversation is to use “I feel…. I want” statements to replace your contempt statements. ● No: Geesh, we went over this same material three days in a row. Do you have holes in your brain that you can’t retain the information? ● Yes: I feel frustrated when we review the same information multiple times. I want to feel stimulated and excited. Can we move to the next step? 2. Contempt behaviors are often surprising and aggressive. Team members can often be at a loss for how to respond or may respond with another toxic behavior that escalates the situation. One de-escalating strategy is to address the behavior directly without “You” statements: ● No: Your eye-rolling has got to stop. ● Yes: I feel threatened and demeaned when you roll your eyes during the discussion. Can you help me understand what is happening for you? 3. Another way to de-escalate contempt statements is to address them by asking the person exhibiting the behavior to clarify the intention. This can help the person with the

behavior understand that their behavior is not acceptable and can also clarify for others when insult or offensive behavior may be unintentional.  ● Yes: What are you trying to accomplish by doing that? ● Yes: Can you clarify your intention in saying that? 4. Another useful strategy that can be used in a one-on-one situation to address concerns about behavior is to utilize the SBI Feedback Model37 which describes the situation from your point of view, the feeling or impact it has on you, and what you would prefer to be different. ● No: I noticed you were bothered yesterday. Every time Sasha shared an idea you rolled your eyes and sighed. You were making everyone uncomfortable. What was going on? ● Yes: I noticed that in the meeting yesterday you rolled your eyes and sighed when Sasha shared his ideas. I was uncomfortable with these responses, and I am concerned about the impact it may have on the team’s ability to collaborate in safety. Can you give me your perspective on what was happening? It is often most helpful to introduce these Toxic Communication Strategies and the counteracting healthy communicating strategies to teams when things are going well or during team formation activities. By doing this in a fun way, the team can enjoy the vulnerability of exposing their humanness and develop language and agreements on how they will be when these toxic strategies inevitably show up. This will help them grow in their ability to identify these and develop responses that are de-escalating and create better team psychological safety and increase the willingness to collaborate.  Not only that, but they will also have a rich array of tools at their disposal to help guide the team. Keep in mind that most of the de-escalation strategies work on any of the toxic communications so by simply learning one or two that feel comfortable to you, you can have a strong tool to reduce conflict to a healthy level.

You’ve heard the term “beating a dead horse,” right? That’s exactly what you don’t want to do when it comes to ending a coaching engagement. There’s no sense in trying to breathe new life into something that has run its course, and a coaching engagement may have run its course for any number of reasons.  37  https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/closing-the-gap-between-intent-vs-impact-sbii/

Part of your job as a professional Agile enterprise coach is to be aware of signs that indicate the end has come, and then exit with poise, professionalism, and grace. This chapter provides information that helps you ascertain how to know when: ● You’re done ● You’re done for now ● It’s time to fire the client ● You’re about to get fired ●  It’s time to give up Let’s start by looking at the definition of “done.”  What It Means to be “Done” In the most general sense, an engagement is “done” when a coach is disengaging with whoever they are working with and moving on. But the definition varies slightly based on the role. It’s different for external consultants than it is for those that are working at the company. When an engagement is over for external coaches, it could mean they no longer work for the company, period. If they were working with a specific department or team within the company, it could also mean that they are finished working with that segment and they are moving on to work with another group within that same company. Internal coaches are employees of the company, and they generally don’t walk out the door when an engagement is over. They typically move on to the next group or department that requires their expertise, remaining within the company while retaining a coaching role. How to Know When You’re Done One of the most common and straightforward ways to know an engagement is over is by acknowledging all the goals have been met. The initial agreement describes what it will look like when the goals are complete. Once the goals are hit, you’re done. Develop a coaching plan that clearly indicates the outcomes the client is looking for and how they will measure success in the beginning of the engagement. This will give you both a way to inspect progress along the way and shift goals or call certain things done - even before all the measures of success are met if the return-on-investment warrants calling it done. If you have a limited engagement contract like a certain number of months, hours, workdays, or sessions it’s a bit easier to see and plan for an exit. However, in many of these engagements, the client is getting enough value that they find the budget to extend the contract. Michael: When you’re crafting the engagement, think of how your time can be best used to benefit the client. Instead of putting four weeks of work into a single month, you can spread it out. I’ve had agreements where I would spread 100 days of work over a year. The client and I

mutually agreed on what times I should be working, and that the 100 days should be allocated over a 365-day period. I worked a lot at the start of our engagement and reduced from there. At the beginning, I would work five days a week, then four days a week, then three days a week. Toward the end, I was only working one day a week. Allocating the work in this way gave the client a greater impact at the same cost. It also allowed them to digest their own changes before we moved on to the next item. It was more beneficial than having me there 100 days straight. Your agreement with the client may also consist of a mix of on-site and off-site work. Some coaches charge less for off-site work than for onsite. This, along with any travel expense considerations, needs to be factored into the agreement when establishing the overall amount of work that’s to be done and the cost for that work. Costs are very often time-based as a consultant, and you want to make sure your client is getting the greatest value they can for their budget. You also need to be realistic about how much change is possible: How much can be done in a month? Six months? One year? Another way to set up the engagement is by breaking a one-year period into four quarters of cycles. You can provide four cycles of coaching over the year, with each cycle consisting of a specific set of reasonable and attainable goals. However, the agreement is set up, it’s crucial that it defines the engagement while also outlining a measurable, mutually agreed upon definition of success. In addition to achieving all the goals outlined in the agreement, other indications that your coaching engagement is done include: ● Time or budget ran out: This can apply whether the goals have been met, based on the amount of time or sessions designated in the initial agreement. When the client has a limited budget, you agree to do what you can in the time you have but don’t over-promise. You can only control what you do. You can’t control the rate at which the client adopts change or learns. Communicate throughout and help them to find ways to continue once your engagement ends. ●  The coach/client engagement is not a good match: Certain relationships just don’t click. It’s a waste of your time and your client’s time if you happen to enter one of them. ● A mutual agreement can also end the engagement. Both client and coach may realize they don’t need each other any longer and continuing the engagement wouldn’t make sense. ● The client doesn’t want to make progress: Sometimes clients simply don’t want to change, even if they were gung-ho about the idea when they hired you. Other times they can only tolerate and consume so much change at one time and they need a break to digest what they have and really make it part of the working culture before doing anything more. Michael: Sometimes an engagement will be done but the client wants to continue working together. I’ve had clients sign up for a certain amount of work but wanting more work once our

initial engagement is complete. That typically means creating a new engagement that outlines a new set of goals and terms.  How to Know When You’re Done for Now As you saw with the example of spreading the coaching work over an extended period, coaching doesn’t necessarily happen all at once in a short burst of intensity. Some clients may prefer to work with a coach for several months, then pause the coaching while they make progress on their own. After the client’s changes have been implemented, the coach may circle back and work for another set period. The process could be repeated as frequently as needed or desired.    Cherie: One way to craft an agreement is to define the pauses up front. I’ll work with clients over a year-long period, breaking it down into quarters. In the first quarter, I’ll conduct a class and provide two weeks of coaching, for a total of three weeks of coaching for that quarter. In the second quarter, we’ll repeat the process with a different class. It ends up as three weeks of coaching per quarter, or one week of work per month which might be spread throughout the month and not necessarily consecutive days. Michael has entered similar engagements. Michael: With some clients, I’ll facilitate PI (Program Increment38) planning once per quarter. We’ll have a large group planning session where I help them do planning for a quarter, and that’s the extent of the coaching I’ll do for those three months. I’ll come back in the next quarter and help them with the next round of PI planning. It’s all set up in the contract, designating when we’re done for now. I’ll do a little bit of work, pause, and then a little bit more. Another way to set up this type of engagement is to implement an assessment with recommendations. After an initial assessment, the client moves forward and incorporates the recommendations. The client may call the coach back if they need help with some of the recommendations as they execute the plan. The coach then returns to reassess the situation. Again, this setup is outlined up-front in the coaching contract. Cherie has used her own assessment model and Agility Health39 for this purpose. Alex does amazing work with Evidence

Based Management40 assessments and consulting to help leaders of companies learn how to collect and utilize hard data to make evidence-based decisions and measure progress.  Michael: These are some of the ways to get coaching without having a full-time coach, which can be particularly beneficial to the client. Having a full-time coach could hurt the client’s success. It comes with the risk of creating dependency.  How to Know When It’s Time to Fire the Client While many coaching engagements end with a mutual agreement that the time has come, that’s not always the case. There may be situations where firing the client is the best – or only – course of action. Firing the client could mean ending the engagement with a team or specific group you’re working with. Or it could involve terminating work with an entire organization or a company. Clients may need to be fired if they’re not meeting the agreements of the contract. For coaching to work, the coach needs to work with a team of people or a person with authority who owns change. That’s part of the contract. If the client doesn’t provide that, it’s time to move on. The client isn’t ready to make the investment in their own change. You can’t make the change for them - they must be ready. Cherie: I require access to the people with authority who hold the budget and have the power to reinforce change. These people need to be involved with the coaching process for change to take place. If the client says those people are not available, I’ll have a hard conversation with them, explaining the necessity of making those people available. If those people are still not available after the hard conversation, it’s time to let the client go. If they’re not doing their part, I can’t do my part. The coach can’t change the company for the client. The client needs to do it themselves. And if the people with authority who own the change aren’t on board, no change can occur. It doesn’t make sense to continue. Sometimes you focus on the team level, and they have made as much change as possible with the level of authority they have. Then, managers become the blockers to further movement forward. If that level is not willing to change, then they are giving you the signal that the organization has tolerated all the change they can handle at this time. At whatever level the resistance to change becomes an immovable blocker to progress, it becomes the ceiling. No change can occur beyond that point until that level is ready to move forward. In many cases this is a symptom of “I want change, but I don’t want to change,” which frequently happens. Managers will point at the level beneath them or at teams and say, “They need to change,” while refusing to change themselves. This is often also a symptom of them wanting the coach to do the work for them. “You change everything and make my organization better and I’ll just keep

doing the same things I’ve always done and soak in the benefits.”  In such cases, it’s crucial to have a conversation with management. Cherie: I generally have a straightforward conversation with the management team explaining to them that the layer beneath them has achieved all it can achieve without change and support from their level. “This team is the impediment to more progress in the organization at this point,” I’ll tell management. “What do you want to do about this?” Usually, they say they are invested in change, and they are on board. I’ll then give them 30 days to stop blocking change and to make some progress forward. Sometimes they start making progress after understanding the impact they were having. Other times nothing changes. I have a second conversation with them letting them know that I am giving them a conditional 30-day notice. If their behavior continues to hinder progress, and they show no evidence that they intend to move forward, I disengage and either move on to another area of the company or end the engagement. Toxic environments can be another reason to fire a client. These can include environments rife with elements like extreme conflict, politics, and deception. It can also be environments where people exhibiting toxic behaviors are promoted because the work, they do is good quality. This is often one of the indicators that the management team is not ready to make further changes. Cherie says, “If they enable a toxic environment, they aren’t ready for the kind of work I do.” If the client says they want to make changes that create a less toxic environment, and they exhibit behaviors that indicate they are invested in the change, it may be okay to continue. But that’s not always the case. It’s time to fire the client if a toxic environment continues to persist, or if the toxic nature of the environment is impacting the coach personally. Sometimes you will get into an organization who said all the right things to get you in the door. Then, after getting there you realize that the leader who brought you in did so under duress. Cherie has had clients ask her to stay on as a coach even when they knew that they did not intend to move any further because their boss required them to have a coach on staff and like the atmosphere when she’s around. While that kind of engagement can be lucrative and easy - getting paid to hang around doing nothing, it is not fun and borders on unethical. Michael: I was once coaching a 500-person organization and the person in charge was the impediment. He constantly undermined what we were trying to do. He refused to alter his outlook or behaviors. I fired the client. Two years after I left, he was fired. While he was there blocking changes, there was no progress that could possibly be made. I have all sorts of examples of toxic environments, or environments where Agile coaching just wasn’t going to work. My boss at one organization did not know what Agile was. Another boss was acting in ways that were extremely toxic and dysfunctional. There’s no light at the end of the tunnel in such cases. The only feasible action to take was to fire them. When the client starts to see you as part of their staff and they stop listening to you and expect you to start listening to them, it can be an indicator that it’s time to end the engagement.

Cherie: I have always made it my standard practice to not have agile coaching engagements that are contracted for more than a year. I might extend it out a few months at the end of the contract if things are moving at a good pace and there is obvious value I can still add. However, what I’ve noticed happen with Agile coaches who stay on for a few years is that the client becomes used to them being there and starts to see them as staff augmentation. In those cases, it isn’t unusual for the client to stop listening to the sound advice of the coach. Instead, they expect the coach to conform to the client’s bad habits instead of helping them change them. This type of scenario goes against my values as a coach so I avoid it by telling the client from the beginning that I will only be here one year, and they are going to have to learn how to do this without me. That message remains consistent and helps the client to remember that I’m only there for a short time and they need to draw as much value from me as possible before I’m gone. It also forces them to be dependent upon themselves instead of me because I won’t be around long term. I have a specific purpose to fulfill - to get them ready to do this without me.  How to Know When You’re About to Get Fired On the flipside, an engagement may end when the client is prepping to fire the coach. There’s a difference between not having your contract renewed and getting fired. Not having the contract renewed is a normal thing for external consultants. Being fired is generally not. The former involves shaking hands and parting on agreeable terms. The latter involves not renewing with a bad taste left, or the client terminating the agreement early for reasons other than company budget cuts. For a full-time coach, getting fired involves getting marched out of the office and told not to come back. “Turn in your badge, and don’t let the door hit you while you’re leaving.” Telltale signs you’re about to get fired include: Lack of communication: People are no longer communicating with you. You send an email, and you don’t get a reply. From anyone. People avoid you in the hallways. Demotion or losing access: You may go from working with C-level executives to VP-level executives, and then down to teams. You become uninvited to meetings and lose access to the change makers in the organization. Escalation: Instead of discussing problems with you or being straightforward about what’s going on, people may start to go two levels above your head to complain about you. When you are the problem: The coach may be creating friction within the company. This happens when you want something for the client that they don’t want for themselves. You’re trying to push your agenda against their will or desires. In such cases, you’re not managing the situation. The situation is managing you. If these things are happening to you, it’s a good time to stop and evaluate the situation. What can you learn from this that can make you do better in the future? Rather than blaming the client or the environment, take a hard look at how you’ve been interacting with them. Are you the

problem? This might be a good time to ask for feedback. If the bridge between you isn’t completely burnt down to the ground, you may be able to get back on stable ground. At the very least, you may be able to learn what you did wrong, so you don’t keep repeating the same mistakes again and again. Sometimes it’s simply not a good fit or what you want and what the client wants is just too far apart. Usually, these things can be avoided with good pre-engagement conversations and agreements. Being willing to say no to engagements that aren’t a good fit can also help you to avoid these situations. Not everyone is at a point in their career where they can turn down jobs that don’t feel like the right fit for them. However, if you can hold out a bit longer and wait for a good fit, you’ll be better off in the end. If you are a coach who works on contracts or subcontracts and doesn't get paid when you’re not working, it’s important to plan for those times when you are not working. Being in a financial position to go without a contract for several months or up to a year can give you freedom to take the right jobs and not just any jobs. It’s worth the discipline to make the investment in your own stability so you can have an enjoyable career. How to Know When It’s Time to Give Up Finally, you’ll know it’s time to give up on the engagement if you are feeling exhausted, depleted or otherwise ready to collapse. In our hard-working, push-yourself society, it’s vital to pay attention to signs that it’s time to give up before you end up pushing yourself over the edge. These signs can include: Taking medication to handle stress or anxiety: If a client situation has you turning to medication for relief, it’s likely in your best interest to terminate the engagement. This also applies if you’re suffering from migraines, sleep disturbances or insomnia that you attribute to the work. Not getting paid enough: If clients can’t afford to pay you at the level you need, or if the pay is decidedly below your skill level and contribution, you may want to pack your bags. Continuing in such a situation has the potential to start breeding resentment and, in turn, actions or behaviors you may later regret. When you see yourself “giving up:” You’ll feel this when it’s happening. If you find yourself at work but you’re not happy to be there you may start cutting corners, or stop being fully engaged or present in your work. You might show up out of obligation and not be motivated to engage. At times like this it’s important to evaluate where you can re-engage and get motivated again. If you can’t, it may be an indication that your time there has come to its natural end. Not maintaining a sustainable pace: Long hours, exhausting tasks, and going full steam ahead for too long with too little rest is a guaranteed recipe for a breakdown. If you are doing this to yourself, take time to evaluate why. Are you in over your head? Are you working extra hours to get the hourly rate? Are you using work to cover up some other emotional issue, so you

don’t have to deal with it? If it's the client who is forcing the extra hours, it may be time to move on if it’s impacting your mental or physical health. When you don’t care anymore: This occurs not when you see yourself giving up, but when you’ve given up. You simply don’t care about what’s going on. It’s not fair to the client and not good for you to continue. You’re wasting your time and their money. Do the right thing and disengage. When they see you as a captive employee: Once upon a time you were a respected coach that held their attention. They listened and acted. Now you’ve become just another employee on the scene, and they’ve all stopped listening. When you’re emotionally charged: Being angry is one of the most common scenarios, but you could also be filled with other extremely strong, raw, uninhibited emotions. You’re a ticking time bomb, ready to explode.   If one or more of these signs become part of your daily life, go fill up your gas tank by taking a break.  Summing It Up Entering a new coaching agreement can be exciting and full of promise. In some cases, so can ending the engagement. While certain engagements may not end on the highest note, others can be cause for celebration. The excitement comes from knowing your client can confidently move forward without you, with the promise of sustaining the new concepts and changes they’ve implemented. Both are surefire signs that your Agile coaching made a positive impact – and that you can consider it a job well done.

Chapter 1: Introduction  Cynefin, pronounced “kuh-nev-in,” is a Welsh word that signifies the multiple factors in our environment and our experience that influence us in ways we could never understand [snowden_leader_2007]. The Cynefin framework is a framework built on sense-making, which is the way humans choose between multiple possible interpretations of various types of input to make sense of the world and decide how to respond to it [snowden_multiontology_2005]. In other words, first, how do we make enough sense of the world so that we can act in it? And second, there is the concept of sufficiency: how do we know enough about the world so that we can act in it meaningfully?   The two key principles for a usable practical decision-making model are: 1. The model must be simple enough to draw on the back of a table napkin -- from memory. If we can’t do that, the concept is of little use in day-to-day decision-making.  And, if that is the case, the concept will surely have no impact at all on our decision-making strategy. Huge models are designed to create dependency on the model creator [see: snowden_table_2015]. 2. For any information or visualization to lead directly to an action, it must be easy to instantly understand without a secondary interpretation. When the decision makers need to have the data interpreted, all sorts of problems come into play. The more interpretive41 layers there are, the more likely things we need to pay attention to will get missed. And the more hidden assumptions we’ll have. To make the best decisions, the interpretive layers between the raw data and the decision maker need to be removed.42  Cynefin is a decision support framework that can be used both strategically and operationally. The model provides a structured thinking process for decision making that considers strategy and routine functional operations and recognizes diverse ways of thinking.  Cynefin was designed as much as a conflict resolution framework as for understanding decision-making[snowden_liminal_2019].  Cynefin allows us to have a differentiating conversation. It helps us see things  41 aka mediation 42 The process of removing the interpretive layers between raw data and the decision maker is called disintermediation. [snowden_disintermediation_2016]

from various perspectives.  It creates a shared language that allows people to understand each other at different levels and between different functions in an organization [snowden_fractality_2015] The language we use determines what we do. If the language we use to describe or analyze is different from the language we use to discuss actions, we have introduced a mediation layer.  There is a British phrase — “horses for courses,” meaning that each racehorse runs better on different types of ground. So, if betting on racehorses, we would bet on different horses depending on if they were racing on wet or dry ground. It also means that it is important to choose suitable people for particular activities, because everyone has different skills. The Cynefin idea is, once we understand the nature of the system, we will take a different approach for discovery and intervention/action. Different approaches work in different contexts. To use a philosophical phrase — ontology43 determines epistemology44.  In general, people try to apply one universal approach in a situation where different contexts require different solutions. The problem with things like Six Sigma is that because they come with an ontological assumption, rather than with an ontological discovery, they impose a wrong universal model. All such techniques try to impose universality.  One of the unique things about Cynefin, and one of its key principles, is: we are not saying that traditional techniques are wrong, and we can’t use them. We are actually saying they are right within the proper context and its boundaries. There is nothing wrong with best practices in a rigidly constrained system. There is, however, everything wrong with best practices outside a rigidly constrained system.  There is nothing wrong with doing experimental probes within a complex system. But there is everything wrong with spending money on probes if we’ve got a rigidly constrained system. To say, “Everything is complex,” is as foolish as saying, “Everything is ordered.” Human beings have learned how to create constraints to produce predictability, and that’s part of our success.  Cynefin is about cognitive efficiency and recognition of diversity, without arguments. If we agree on which domain we are in, we immediately move into some type of action. We know where to look when things are shifting.      43 Ontology: a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that shows their properties and the relations between them. [New Oxford American Dictionary] 44 Epistemology: the theory of knowledge, especially with regard to its methods, validity, and scope. Epistemology is the investigation of what distinguishes justified belief from opinion. [New Oxford American Dictionary]

Chapter 2: Organization To understand what constitutes a system, we need to understand what is meant by “organization.” It will be easier for us to define what an organization is if we ask ourselves, what is the opposite of "organization"? The opposite of organization is chaos. Chaos is when we have many things that are not constrained by anything. The word “constrained” is important here. To understand what a constraint is, we first need to understand what variety is. Variety (or diversity) means the number of distinct elements in a set. For example, the variety of the set of human sexes {Male; Female} is 2. A constraint is a relation between two sets; it occurs when the variety that exists under one arrangement is less than the variety that exists under another.   For example, if a certain school admits only boys, the variety in the set of sexes within the school {Male} is 1. Since 1 is less than 2, a constraint exists in that school.  Another example is the moon orbiting the Earth. In theory, the moon can occupy any position on the space-time continuum. However, in practice, it occupies a smaller set of positions that describe a particular curve. That is - something restricts the moon from taking some of the other theoretically possible positions. And what limits it? Gravity. Hence, we can say that gravity is the constraint. Further, it follows that every law of nature is a constraint, e.g., the Newtonian law says that, of all possible velocities and positions of the planetary bodies, only a smaller set will actually occur, and then the law specifies what values the elements will have [ashby_variety_2011].  The intensity or the level of a constraint is the reduction it causes in the variety of a given set. Thus, a constraint that reduces the variety from 10 to 1 is more rigid than a constraint that reduces the variety from 10 to 5.  Constraints may be coupling or containing. The first constraint defines the boundaries around something, while the second constraint defines the interactions between entities that form a part of the system [salmon_causal_1990]. Constraints may be physical -- as in a production system. They may also be intangible -- as a policy/practice in an organization. The physical constraints may also be further constrained by the types of policies/practices.  There is also a constraint if the state of one thing depends on the state of another. By state, we understand not only the properties of one thing and its values, but also the positions in the space it can occupy. For humans, state means the values they can share; the methods they can use; the goals they can pursue; the functions they can perform; the rules they must follow. In general, a resource constraint is a situation in which an organization has 

---

## Page 192

 
192 
fewer resources than it perceives to need. The important thing is that the constraint is what people perceive to be true, not what is objectively true. In general, we have the following types of constraints: ● time ● resources: knowledge, information, finance, working conditions, etc.  ● space — volume, area Space constraints do not have to be “physical” constraints. They may be a constrained private space. That is what we call "transparency." Hence, transparency is a constraint.  Why do we focus on transparency? Because later, we will see that transparency is a value in Kanban, and one of the three pillars of Scrum. From this point of view, the world around us is full of constraints. But because we are so accustomed to them, we take most of them for granted, and in fact, often we are not even consciously aware that they exist. To see what the world would look like if a fraction of its usual constraints doesn’t exist, consider fairy tales, or the cinema. A world without constraints would be totally chaotic.  Having described what a constraint is, we will now give our definition of “organization.” An organization is one or more constraints on the properties of a thing: on the positions it may occupy; the choices it can make; the actions it can take; the values it can share; the methods it can use; the goals it can pursue; the functions it can perform; and the rules it must follow.  Generally speaking, an organization is a set of constraints applied to a thing, or a group of things.

 Chapter 3: System Organization and Structure A system is a set of things that an organization is applied to. Here are examples of organized systems. The solar system consists of nine planets whose organization is based on constraints — Newton's three laws. Another example is the tax collecting organization, the so-called tax system. System and organization are used interchangeably in everyday language. We say, “Let’s make an organization with a purpose ..."; or "The judicial system is organized as ...". It is important to understand the difference, and the relationship, between the "structure" and the "organization" of a system. An organization includes the connections between the components of a system that must be available for the system to exist. The organization determines the dynamics of interactions in the system, and the permissible transformations of the system[prom_tree_1992]. The organization embodies the identity of a system. If the organization of a system changes, its identity will also change [maturana_autopoiesis_1980]. In a human system, the organization represents the established practice. Accordingly, the established practice determines the identity of the system. The structure of a system, which is the specific implementation of an organization, represents the specific components -- and the specific relationships between them -- that make an organization actually exist [maturana_autopoiesis_1980]. Although the organization is abstract, the structure that implements it is real. Therefore, each organization can be implemented by many different structures. Let's take an example of a mechanical device, like a car. The specific structure of a particular car model may change if we have leather instead of fabric seats. This change in structure will not change the fact that the whole is organized as a car. We should have no problem recognizing such a machine, despite the fact that each car can be made with a different structure and materials. This is, in other words, a duality between the organizational and structural descriptions of a system. It seems that we humans cannot characterize an organization unless there is a way to associate it with some specific structure. At the same time, no particular structure can account for the perception of existence45 it generates unless it is characterized in terms of the organization to which it belongs. We need to simultaneously keep the relationship between the organization  45 its phenomenology

and the structure of a system intact, and not confuse the two types of descriptions, which is easy to do [varela_principles_1979].

Chapter 4: Typology and Taxonomy There are differences between how we perceive things, how we know things and how things actually are. The fact that those three differences exist does not mean that reality does not exist. In philosophy, phenomenology is the way we perceive things, epistemology is the way we know things, and ontology means the fundamental nature of things – how they actually are.  First, we shall see how Cynefin clarifies the types of system based on what they objectively are. There are two basic approaches to classification - typology and taxonomy. The first is typology, which conceptually separates a given set of items multidimensionally. In a typology, the dimensions represent concepts, which do not necessarily exist in physical reality. As such typologies generate heuristics46 which are more adaptive under changing circumstances. On the downside the dimensions (concepts) can be arbitrary, may not be exhaustive and can easily be subject to clashes of interpretation. A taxonomy, on the other hand, which classifies things based on clear empirical47 characteristics, could have rules that allow certain things to be assigned a location. Taxonomies have clear boundaries and allow for rapid decision-making. On the downside, once a taxonomy is established, if something does not fit, it will be forced to fit. Thus, the taxonomy itself creates a filtering mechanism through which we can filter observable characteristics [smith_typologies_2002]. Cynefin uses a hybrid classification. It is a typology, in that its dimensions are conceptual, are based on heuristics, and come from people’s own interpretation of their own unique context. At the same time, the dimensions are based on natural science; hence, Cynefin can also be used as a taxonomy, although with care [snowden_typology_2011]. Based on the concept of “constraint,” the Cynefin typology classifies the world into three types of systems: Ordered, Complex and Chaotic [snowden_strategy_2005].

 Figure 1: Three types of systems.  If there are no constraints, the system is Chaotic. If the constraints are severe enough for the system to be predictable, it’s Ordered, If the constraints are loose, it’s Complex. That means that changing the constraints can change the nature of the system -- and consequently, the nature of the appropriate situational assessment and decision making. In summary: in Cynefin, Ordered, Complexity and Chaos are ontological states with phase shifts (transitions) between them [snowden_strategy_2005]. There’s also a little fold beneath the Order to Chaotic boundaries, to show how rigid order can fall into chaos.

 Chapter 5: Order, Complexity and Chaos Some people see order, complexity, and chaos as being different in the degree of how rigid the constraints are. In Cynefin, we see order, complexity, and chaos as different in the kind of rigidity of constraints. The idea is that, as the constraints get more rigid, a transition called “phase shift” occurs. The result of a phase shift is that the system changes its nature. For example, if we heat up water to 100ºC, it gradually becomes steam.  If, on the other hand, the temperature drops to 0ºC, then the water slowly becomes ice. In a metaphor - Ordered is solid, Complex is liquid, Chaotic is gas [kauffman_origins_1993]. The phase shift is not a spectrum or a gradient, but a clear boundary [snowden_propensities_2016].  Phase shift transitions either produce energy, or require, energy as input48. The nature of humans is that we quickly create connections and constraints intuitively as well as deliberately. To create and sustain a human system in a chaotic state with no effective constraints takes a lot of energy, both to create and to sustain the chaos [snowden_cynefin_2019a].  A shift from Chaotic to Complex does not take any energy and would happen naturally. A shift from Complex to Order, however, takes a big energy input, because we are creating a high level of constraint.   Cynefin has explicit boundary conditions since human beings don’t cope very well with gradients; we need to create boundaries. Having a boundary is essential to human sense-making.  Give us a gradient, and we settle where we are most comfortable; but create a boundary, and then we can behave differently on the other side. We need to be able to say – on this side, things are different. Probably the most difficult thing for people to grasp is that contradictory things work well on different sides of a boundary, e.g., Quantum mechanics49 works very differently from Newtonian mechanics50.  In Cynefin, the boundary conditions are also domains in more sophisticated uses. We will not cover this topic here, but it’s useful to know that the transitions between domains are called liminal states. [snowden_liminal_2017]      48 From a physics perspective, Chaotic is a lower energy state than Complex, and is a proper term in the domain of natural closed systems. But here we are talking about human systems, and those are open, not closed.  49 the branch of mechanics that deals with the mathematical description of the motion and interaction of subatomic particles, incorporating the concepts of quantization of energy, wave-particle duality, the uncertainty principle, and the correspondence principle. 50the system of mechanics which relies on Newton's laws of motion concerning the relations between forces acting and motions occurring

Chapter 6: Cynefin Model As we learned, Cynefin classifies objective reality into three types of systems - Ordered, Complex, and Chaotic.  We also saw how to distinguish between the types of systems by using the concept of constraint. Those three types are objective and can be used to both describe and understand the natural world. However, human knowledge is intrinsically a subjective construction, not an objective reflection, of reality. This means that the emphasis should shift from the apparently objective systems around us to the cognitive and social processes by which we construct our subjective models of those systems. This constitutes a major break with traditional systems theory, which implicitly assumes that there is an objective structure or organization in the systems we investigate. This is reinforced by the concepts of autonomy and self-organization, which imply that the structure of a system is not given, but rather developed by the system itself, as a means to survive, and then adapt to a complex and changing environment [heylighen_philosophy_2006]. That’s why Cynefin also has four states (Clear, Complicated, Complex, Chaos) that represent the ways we know things and, accordingly, how we act. Each state is characterized by an appropriate decision model. Most importantly, the Cynefin framework is not about “objective” reality, but about perception and understanding. We understand that different people might be perceiving, and thus hold different perspectives on, the same event or situation. Such an understanding can be used to one’s advantage in many ways. What we care most about is how people perceive and make sense of situations in order to make decisions Accordingly, in Cynefin there are five domains - Clear, Complicated, Complex, Chaos, Confused - that help us understand how humans perceive the current situation they are in [kurtz_new_2003]. Some people see the differences between Order, Complex, Chaotic as only about perception. In Cynefin, we see the differences as being about reality, knowledge, and perception – hence, the three types of systems and five domains.  In order to get better alignment inside an organization, what we actually need is to increase the friction between perception, knowledge, and reality. If we allow reality, knowledge, and perception to separate wildly, everything becomes totally inauthentic. If we increase the interaction (friction) between perception, knowledge, and reality, the three will never be fully aligned, but at the same time, the misalignment never goes too far.    The five Cynefin domains are presented graphically as the Cynefin model.

These are the five main situations in which human beings would make decisions. The focus of a domain name is on the nature of the system. The action phrases (e.g., probe-sense-respond) reference how we should gain knowledge and then act. Methods and practices also have characteristics that place them in domains, or in transition between domains. Hence, the designation of Best/Good/Exaptive51/Novel52 practice.    
 Figure 2: Cynefin model.  The right-hand domains (Complicated, Clear) are those of order, and the left-hand domains (Complex, Chaos) are those of un-order. Un-order is not the lack of order, but a different kind of order, and is legitimate in its own way [kurtz_new_2003]. The central area is the domain of Confusion. The shift between order and chaos is shown as a catastrophic fold - a walk over the cliff,  51 a trait, feature, or structure of an organism or taxonomic group that takes on a function when none previously existed or that differs from its original function which had been derived by evolution  52 new and not resembling something formerly known or used: not previously identified

without realizing what will happen until it is too late.  The shift shows how easily obvious solutions can cause complacency and lead to a fall into chaos.  Cynefin divides Order into two domains – Clear and Complicated. The separation is a question of perception - some see an issue as obvious, while others see it as hopelessly complicated. Human perception is important for action, and Cynefin is an action-based framework. We may say that Clear is visibly ordered and Complicated is ordered too, but hidden, so that we have to unhide it. The separation is not “objective,” but about human perception and knowledge, so it is shown in a lighter shade of grey. As we saw earlier, the boundaries between the other three domains are about objective reality, knowledge, and perception, all together.  Each domain has its own particular relationship with cause and effect. With Cynefin, we can avoid using a practice established on assumptions of causality in the non-causal domains, and vice versa.  In the ordered domains, there is a known, obvious, and self-evident (Clear) or knowable (Complicated) relationship between cause and effect.     In the complex domain, there probably isn’t a relationship between cause and effect, and even if there is, it is nonlinear, and delayed. Such a cause-and- effect relationship is called “retrospective coherence.” It means that, in hindsight, it's easy to explain why things happened, yet it is impossible to predict them ahead of time; hence, retrospective coherence cannot be used as a basis for acting in the present. Some caution is in order - retrospective coherence may be perceived as “self-evident”! In chaos, there is no relationship between cause and effect at all - the system is, in a sense, random. Cynefin is a fractal framework. Fractality means we may find something to be complicated on one level, but complex on another.  Organization faces situations and issues that can be placed within the various Cynefin domains. The organization as a whole can be in multiple domains, or - and this is critical - in a state of dynamic shift between domains.  All four domains have equal value. We need to really emphasize this: the essence of the Cynefin approach is not to say that complexity is good, and that order is wrong. The key is to understand which domain we are in and just as important, how we plan to move between domains.  There is nothing wrong with order if we can maintain constraints because that produces predictability.

Chapter 7: Clear Domain In the Clear domain, the constraints are rigid and fixed. Linear relationship between cause and effect not only exists, but its nature and consequential actions are self-evident to any reasonable person. For example, driving on the same side of the road – the left side in Britain, and the right side everywhere else -- is the reasonable thing to do, because everybody is doing the same in those countries. In the Clear domain, the way we know things and act is sense, categorize, and then respond, based on best practices.  What should organizations do? Clear problems have known solutions. Since constraints are fixed, no deviation is allowed; organizations employ best practices to manage their processes. Best practices incorporate solutions to problems, stored as recurring patterns that allow for high performance as they are detailed and precise steps, sometimes at the edge of automatic responses. They minimize costs, reduce uncertainty, and increase control over processes. In this perspective, deviations from rational decisions are labeled as “biases and errors” primarily caused by human error, e.g., "operator error, organization error, maintenance error, design error, installation error and assembly error.” Applying best practice doesn’t need experts - it is clear to everyone. However, defining appropriate best practices is primarily reserved for the organization's experts.  Organizational structures are bureaucratic; processes are oriented towards formal procedures and controls. Structured techniques are not only desirable but mandatory. When the future is believed to be predictable, and full information is made available, decision makers will stick to single-point forecasting. This is when we assign a single value to an outcome, e.g., to forecasting that the temperature at a given place on a given day will be 23 degrees Celsius.  In contrast, probabilistic forecasts assign a probability to several different outcomes.  In Clear situations, the focus is on efficiency and consistency. [kurtz_new_2003]. We monitor for deviance, for two different purposes: (1) compliance; (2) is it time to change? In the Clear domain, predictability is both a benefit and a danger [snowden_liminal_2019a].  Although KPIs – Key Performance Indicators --work, are valuable and necessary in the Clear domain, they need to be easy-to-understand, few in number, and not require constant reference to manuals or half-remembered training [snowden_liminal_2019a].

Chapter 8: Complicated Domain In the Complicated domain, the constraints are governing, but within them is predictability. The difference between rigid constraints (Clear) and governing constraints (Complicated) is important. In the Complicated domain, the right approach is not clear and self-evident, because there are several credible alternative solutions. Hence, we have to use our expertise to select one of the alternatives.  In the Complicated domain, the way we know and then act is to sense, analyze, and then respond.   What should organizations do? Complicated problems, even those with many thousands of components, have a few predictable solutions. It is believed that the environment and the organizations can be fully described, even if, at first glance, that might not be easy or obvious. We can prepare and use models, including systems of differential equations and other high-level math. Since cause-effect relationships are central and are supposed to be given by "nature" or other external authority, experts will, in turn, favor experiments, fact-finding and scenario-planning [kurtz_new_2003]. Within the governing constraints, variation is allowed. If we’ve got the right expertise and the right training that are acknowledged by our peers, then a degree of variation is permitted. A metaphor could be improvisation in jazz - one governing theme and one variation, based on individual musicians. With governing constraints, we have good practice, not best practice; the difference is important. A best practice is obvious and doesn’t need experts. However, if you have to think about it, we can agree on a good practice. Some caution is in order: if we impose best practice in a good practice domain, the people who understand the practice realize that there are variations but are not allowed to perform.  The organizational structures are oriented towards bureaucracy and technical determined processes, managed by formal procedures. Controls are relaxed to allow for variations based on expertise: The right to vary practice is hard won and to a degree bounded by peer review and peer acceptance. Planning and control can be far less explicit because the basics of what are needed are embedded in the professional standards, practices, and training. In this domain alignment on goals and common purpose and goals are useful as they act as a constraint on deviant behavior.  Goals and targets should not be excessive and should never be created by bureaucrats or consultants who lack experience in the context, are not members in the profession, and do not have peer acceptance.   Decision makers have to rely on expert opinion. Experts here are understood

as professional individuals who, through defined training programs, acquire a specialist terminology that is codified in textbooks. The high level of abstraction is teachable, however, given the necessary time, intelligence, and opportunity. As decision makers are regularly not proficient enough in the respective field, relying on expertise shifts authority away from formal hierarchical positions to rather closed communities differentiated from the rest of the organization by a professional identity and a specific language.  The problem in this domain is to stay open for changes despite experts and trivialization, thus, "management of this space requires the cyclical disruption of perceived wisdom53”[snowden_complex_2005].               Chapter 9: Complex, Chaos, and Confused Domains In the Complex domain, there are very loose constraints. This might be perceived as “everything is connected to everything else, but in mysterious ways.”  We call them enabling constraints because they nudge the system to move in a certain direction.   Тhe difference between a governing constraint and an enabling constraint is like the difference between an exoskeleton54 and an endoskeleton55. For an insect with an exoskeleton, everything is contained within the skeleton and doesn’t allow for much variation – that’s a governing constraint.  An endoskeleton has logic and consistency but allows for massive variation – that would be an enabling constraint [snowden_birth_2015].  53 agilists often describe this as "feedback loops" or "inspect and adapt cycles" or "test and learn cycles" 54  a rigid external covering for the body in some invertebrate animals, especially arthropods, providing both support and protection  55 an internal skeleton, such as the bony or cartilaginous skeleton of vertebrates

Also in the Complex domain, there are cause-and-effect relationships, although both the number of components (agents) and the number of relationships defy categorization or analysis. In complex environments, recursive56 effects make it impossible to make a rational choice of actions based on cause and effect. Different observers will end up with varying explanations for the same observation. In a complex system, every intervention changes what is being observed. We have inherent uncertainty57. The agents and the system co-evolve. Yet, system behavior is not chaotic or random. Order emerges from interactions of the agents and the system over time. Since the form the order takes is path dependent, it is unique to each emergence. History is important. Different starting conditions give rise to different outcomes. Once the system changes, it is unable to revert back to its exact former state. Emerging patterns can be perceived but not predicted – we call this phenomenon retrospective coherence [snowden_complex_2005]. We can’t rely on any retrospective e.g., lessons learned, process because if the result was positive or not determines how people would describe what happened. We can say with absolute confidence and guaranteed certainty about complex systems:  whatever we do will produce unintended consequences. So, whatever we do, something will happen that we didn’t expect and/or didn’t plan for. Furthermore, we are responsible for any unintended consequences. Even though we couldn’t have predicted the individual outcome, since we knew for certain that there would be unintended consequences, we should have planned for them. So, we need to do small things early in the game so that the inevitable unintended consequences are more manageable.  How do we know we are in a Complex domain? The basic heuristics are: if the evidence supports a competing hypothesis, if there is a dispute, if time pressure is high -- assume it’s complex. The general default is: if in doubt, assume it’s complex. What if for the expert, it is Complicated, and for the rest of us, it’s Complex? That’s okay. If we trust the expert, we can treat it as Complicated, even though it is Complex for the rest of us. If we don’t trust the expert, then we have to treat it as Complex. We can accept that something is Complicated without understanding it – that’s the essence of humanity. We have to be able to trust experts to make decisions for us. The decision model is: probe via experiments, sense the results and respond by either amplifying good, or dampening bad, emerging patterns [snowden_safetofail_2011]. We need to probe the system; when it comes back, we know it’s ready to move, to have a nudge – because we know its  56 relating to or involving a program or routine of which a part requires the application of the whole, so that its explicit interpretation requires in general many successive executions 57 uncertainty that exists as a permanent, essential, or characteristic attribute

dispositional58 state.   We can safely claim that human systems are complex by default. Why? Because they are comprised of humans, and humans are definitely not consistent in their behavior. The most important indicator of how we would act is the context. The situation or place we find ourselves in may completely change our perception and judgment. Modeling of human systems is possible. As Murray Gell-Mann, who received the 1969 Nobel Prize in physics, famously said: “The only valid model of a human system is the system itself” [boulton_embracing_2015].  Here is a bit more subtle example of that - the “shadow or informal organization, that complex network of obligations, experiences and mutual commitments grounded in shared experiences, values and beliefs, without which an organization could not survive"[snowden_complex_2005]. To convey knowledge, informal networks prefer stories and proverbs. As such a language is difficult to comprehend and use for outsiders. These networks tend to be closed and cohesive circles, more rigidly restricted than professional ones, and prefer excluding rather than including experts. Membership, even if embedded in formal organizations, is often informally regulated. It is based on emotions, common experience, values, or beliefs, with a long time of apprenticeship, (transition) rituals and enforcing myth-like stories, and long tenure [snowden_chapter_2000].  Different types of problems require different management approaches.  The nature of the system determines the ways we acquire knowledge about it and manage it. Both chaotic and ordered systems can be managed in a structured way. With complex relationships in this domain, "relying on expert opinions based on historically stable patterns of meaning will insufficiently prepare us to recognize and act upon unexpected patterns” [kurtz_new_2003]  For complex problems, the role of management is to create and relax constraints as needed, and then to dynamically allocate resources where patterns of success emerge. We manage what we can manage – the boundary conditions, the safe-to-fail experiments, our determination to rapidly amplify or diminish an activity. By applying this process, we discover value at various points along the way.  Managing complex systems means changing the present without a series of stepping stones, but with a rough sense of direction with the willingness to change [snowden_managing_2014].   58 recurrent behavioral tendency

In a complex system, we can only manage the evolutionary potential of the present. We can’t plan long-term, because the cause-and-effect relationships will not be fully known, or knowable, in advance, but understood only retrospectively, in hindsight. Long-term planning is at best a sense of direction rather than a set of goals and targets. A sense of direction can be achieved by visionary goals, but their use has to be done with care. We can plan very short-term, while staying alert and exploiting patterns of possibilities as they start to become visible. However, it is not just about responding to patterns; we can manage the constraints, the catalysts of patterns and the allocation of resources. It is about creating the conditions in which radical re-purposing is easier to stimulate and easy to recognize. Rapid feedback loops, fast failure and learning, and experimentation are all key approaches. The plans and the controls will emerge as we do that. Accordingly, we can only really measure direction and speed of travel from the present.  Exaptation is when -- under conditions of stress -- a trade developed for one function leaps sideways and is re-purposed for a different function/capability altogether [gould_exaptation_1982]. If we look at the evolution – repurposing happens when the system is under stress. If we stress any life form mutation, the rate increases fast. That produces more casualties, but also more variation and more exaptive capacity. Adaptation is a linear evolutionary process - each change happens gradually over time. So, in evolution, we have a linear adaptive process, then we get a stress-based natural leap, and then another linear process. Exaptation accounts for the speed of evolution.  The key on exaptation is to repurpose things in which you are already competent, so that the learning or energy needs are reduced [snowden_cynefin_2019]. Moving to higher levels of abstraction allows us to combine and recombine things in novel ways.  Enabling constraints allows for a huge degree of variety, but there is still governance within the system. If we manage to encapsulate the enabling constraints in the form of governing heuristics or, better still, in the form of habits, then we’ve got a governing structure we can rely on [snowden_purpose_2012].  In human systems, the enabling constraints are called governing heuristics. Generally, decision makers in complex contexts rely, for a substantial proportion of decisions, on heuristics that are adapted to their specific environment. In the Complicated domain we have rules, in the Complex domain we have governing heuristics, one of the ways to embody expert knowledge. Contrary to rules designed to include specific solutions for specific problems, heuristics provide a common structure for a range of similar problems, but also allow for the necessary flexibility in turbulent complex situations and unexpected events. Heuristics handle ambiguity, whereas rules don’t.

Examples of governing heuristics are, “Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software,” “Welcome changing requirements, even late in development,” “Deliver working software frequently”. All twelve principles from the Agile Manifesto are governing heuristics, i.e., enabling constraints. Another example of a governing heuristic comes from the U.S. Marine Corps – if the battlefield breaks down, capture the high ground, stay in touch, and keep moving [snowden_purpose_2012].  Notice that heuristics are measurable for compliance. They are not statements of general principles, which are not heuristics in this sense, because they are too ambiguous. They are measurable – did you capture the high ground, did you stay in touch, did you keep moving? In a governing heuristic, compliance must be measurable -- without ambiguity. Applying broad principles like “Don’t be evil!” won’t work.  Actually, any strategy is an enabling constraint. It gives an organization a direction. Without direction, there is chaos.  We know that if we follow the heuristics, there will be a degree of failure; but that’s acceptable, because it’s considered inevitable. If we try to force a non-failure culture into a complex system, things will get nasty fast.   In the Chaos domain, there are no constraints. Searching for right answers is pointless, because the relationships between cause and effect are impossible to determine.  There is a potential for order, but few can see it; and if they can, they rarely do -- unless they have the courage to act. In this domain, our immediate job is not to discover patterns, but to act.  If we go into chaos deliberately, it takes a huge amount of energy to create.  It is rather like nuclear fusion – the energy required for the magnets to contain the plasma is more than the energy we get out of the nuclear reaction. Making something chaotic is very difficult to do.   The decision model is to act quickly and decisively, then sense and respond.  Chaos is the domain of crises and novel practices.   A crisis is all about control and very little about planning.  There is no time to be nice or consultative, so the imposition of control is likely to be draconian in nature.  The real value comes in working out what to impose and shouldn’t be a final solution; the essence of good crisis management is to create enough constraints that you shift the problem into complexity, which means patterns are starting to emerge [snowden_liminal_2019a].  In the Chaotic domain, novelty arises from stress, from a complete break with the familiar. As a result, radically different approaches would now be accepted, while in normal times they wouldn’t. In order to be effective, the new ways must be accepted by all reasonable people. The case in the chaotic domain is that the

context makes unreasonable stubbornness more difficult to sustain [snowden_cynefin_2019b].  Chaos is relative to the context. We can get micro-chaos as well in a specific context, which is, in general, constrained. As far as the context is concerned, there may be no relationships between cause and effect and all of a sudden, somebody makes a novel connection. Take, for example. the invention of microwave ovens. In 1943, an engineer, Percy Spencer, was building a magnetron when he noticed a chocolate bar melt in his pocket.   Realizing the connection, he placed an egg in a kettle and directed the microwaves from the magnetron into a hole cut into the side of the kettle. The egg exploded.  Voila!  The first microwave!  Raytheon filed the patent in 1945 and made a fortune [snowden_granularity_2013].    Before going into the Confused domain, let’s remind ourselves about that catastrophic fall from Order into Chaos. It happens when we make the system very constrained. Sooner or later, tensions build up in the system and there is a disaster. Breaking the laws becomes the norm, corruption follows, and everything else falls through.  The Confused domain is in the middle of the Cynefin diagram. This domain is as significant as the others, in that it is an entry point into the sense-making process. Remember, Cynefin is a decision support framework, so its focus is on understanding the underlying nature (ontology) of the problem being addressed [snowden_cynefin_2020]. This domain is associated with the idea of uncertainty. It is a state of not knowing which domain we are in. There are authentic and inauthentic ways to deal with such confusion.  The authentic way is to acknowledge upfront that we are in a confused state, and then seek to explore options for exiting the situation. It’s authentic, therefore, to use confusion as a transitionary device to eventually understand what domain the present situation is in.  Thus, when we are confused, we are actually at an entry point into the sense-making process. In the Confused domain, we have primary sense-making, namely, creating a sufficient structure of constraints to shift into a domain where the nature of action is known. We can get into authentic confusion when we deliberately create a state of ambiguity or stress in order to achieve a transition. Some people call being in such a state “aporetic.” The Oxford English Dictionary defines aporetia as a state of “perplexity or difficulty.” In philosophy, an aporia is a puzzle or a seemingly insoluble impasse in an inquiry, often arising as a result of equally plausible yet inconsistent premises (i.e., a paradox).  In Plato's Meno dialogue. Socrates describes the purgative effect of reducing someone to aporia: it shows a person who merely thought he knew something

that he does not in fact know it, and that instills in him a desire to investigate the subject further.   The inauthentic way is not to acknowledge we are confused, or, to acknowledge it but be unable to come out of it. Staying in confusion is truly a bad place to be.  In inauthentic confusion, we assume we are in the domain in which we feel most comfortable – e.g., we feel certainty, when uncertainty should be the norm. It is a state of false confidence, assuming we know how to act without first making an ontological situational assessment. An example of an inauthentic state is when someone tries to apply Six Sigma in software development projects -- by using Complicated techniques while in a Complex situation. Human beings’ situational assessments are often completed on the basis of an action they have already decided to do. In general, humans often try to apply one universal approach in a situation where different contexts actually require different solutions to be applied. That is what traditional management consultancies usually do. Instead of trying to discover the ontological context of their clients, they come with an ontological assumption that it is ordered. As we know, in the Complicated domain, we need good practices, and in the Clear domain, we need best practices. Traditional management consultancies embody good and best practices in business cases. However, the case-based approach is dependent on understanding the context from which the originating cases were derived. If we try to repeat what worked before, the context may have shifted. Since we probably won’t fully understand the context anyway, we can’t rely on it to the same extent.  Тhe fundamental danger with the case-based approach is the confusion of correlation with causation. The fact that we’ve got a correlation doesn’t mean we’ve got a causal link. Trying to repeat a How without understanding the Why is foolish.  Popular-end business books aren’t concerned about that – their correlation is from three cases, based on what the authors want to hear. It appears that those authors started with a conclusion, and then cherry-picked stories that could be fitted to that conclusion. All of the management books are based on the same blue-chip companies -- which should make us suspicious anyway, because those same companies are used for cases that support competing theories.  The danger of being confused is that we may accidentally slip into chaos because in terms of human perception, the Confused and Chaotic domains have much in common.  Unable to withstand the perception of being in chaos, humans tend to panic and impose too-rigid constraints. A situation that is not clear may

lead to a catastrophic fall into chaos. That’s why Cynefin prevents us from jumping into action and instead insists we do a situational assessment first.   Chapter 10: Intervention  The Cynefin framework is first about contextual awareness, followed by contextually appropriate action. So first, we must understand what type of domain we are in. Second, what are the dynamics that shift between domains? Thus, Cynefin has two classification systems: domains and dynamics. As we increase the level of uncertainty the dynamic classification becomes more important than the domain classification.  In an organization, all of the dynamics and all of the domains will be in operation at the same time. For example, at the board level, things may be stable, while at the team level, things may not be stable. Complexity is fractal. Dynamics and domains are value-free! The value lies in the ability to move situations and systems between domains.  
  Figure 3: Four dynamics.

  All four dynamics are presented on Figure 3. [snowden_cynefin_2015] ● The stable dynamic is shown in blue: it moves between the complex and the complicated domains, and, if needed, back again.  ● The yellow line shows the dynamic of shallow dive into chaos: breaking up established practice to allow novel practice to emerge or reset the system in order to allow a new stable dynamic to emerge.  ● The green line shows the dynamic of going down into the Clear domain: when we settle on one best practice of doing things and we enforce that in all barring exceptional circumstances.  ● The red line shows the grazing dynamic, in which the overall volatility is such that stability is rarely other than transitionary; we stay in complexity while constantly skimming the surface of chaos.  The most stable dynamic is the movement between the Complex and the Complicated domains [snowden_cynefin_2015]. People who think that complicated has a negative connotation, however, cherish complexity! We argue that Complicated is not negative. Something that can turn Complex into Complicated is great, because doing so - coherently allows for scalability and repeatability. Pretending something is Complicated when it’s actually Complex, however – that’s an error.  For complex problems, we employ numerous coherent59 and safe-to-fail, fine-grained experiments in parallel. These experiments will provide feedback on what works and what doesn’t. We manage the experiments as a portfolio. Some of the experiments must be oblique, some naïve, some contradictory, some high-risk/high-return types. When we run several probes in parallel, they will change the environment anyway, so the logic is that all probes should be roughly the same size and take roughly the same time to complete.  In practice, those experiments generally merge, mutate, or fail; then a solution or solutions emerge. There is concern that there are insufficient coherent hypotheses, or more important, insufficient contradictions. If that is the case, then we should be concerned that we may have an insufficient range of experiments and may be at risk of missing a key weak signal, or signals.  Then we must apply sense-making to the feedback and respond by continuing or intensifying the things that work, correcting or changing those that don’t. As they start to work in a consistent way, we apply constraints. If we continue with the probes, it is then under increased constraints. Now we get onto the key test – if we increase the constraints and that produces  59 to the individual, not to the group as a whole -- although the group must accept that it is a valid viewpoint

unexpected consequences, we relax the constraints and keep the process into the complex. When we increase the constraints, if that produces predictable behavior, we’ve made the process complicated -- and that’s good news.   Any linear experimental testing/prototyping process is effectively a Complex to Complicated transition by nature. If we were doing parallel, smaller experiments, they would stay in the Complex domain.   Now we’ve successfully moved into the Complicated domain. And that Complex to Complicated cycle is essential, since Complicated is for exploitation, while Complex is for exploration.  When people manage to shift the project to Complicated, since they assume it will always work, they don’t carry on testing. But in reality, the context may shift; in that case, the constraints put in place may no longer produce predictability. If that happens, then we cycle back into Complex. There is a natural cadence to that movement.  Going too slow or too fast between the domains is a mistake. Getting the cadence right is an experimental process and means there is stability.  Generally, people do the movement in a complicated way, but not the reverse. If we don’t do the reverse, however, what will actually happen is that every now and then, we’ll have to perform a “shallow dive into chaos.” Basically, we have allowed things to become entrained, allowing governing constraints when we should have gotten back to Complex. Then we have to break things up in order to allow them to re-form. In other words, we have to get a bit chaotic. And we have to be careful with that.  In the Chaotic domain, the novelty arises from stress, from a complete break with the familiar [snowden_cynefin_2019].  Hans Selye is frequently claimed to be the father of the stress concept. Since he used the term stress for the response rather than for the stimuli, he invented the word stressor for the stimulus that triggered this response. Given that a particular stressor, or set of stressors, is perceived as threatening or negative, humans report this as “stress.” Stress is a general, unspecific alarm response that occurs whenever something is missing, i.e., when there is a discrepancy between goals and reality. In general, the alarm occurs in all situations where expectancies are not met.  The alarm continues until the discrepancy is eliminated, by changing the expectations -- or the reality, when possible. The alarm is uncomfortable, and “drives” the individual to the proper solutions. Stress is, therefore, an adaptive response [ursin_cognitive_2004].  When people are under stress, they face a coping decision:  either to accept the opportunity to cope with the stress, or not. The term coping covers either the result or the act. We’ll look into both -- starting with coping as the result, i.e., a reduced level of stress.  

---

## Page 213

 
213 
Coping is when the individual establishes an expectancy of being able to cope, i.e., an expectancy that most or all responses to a stressor will lead to a reduced stress level. To emphasize – it is neither  the action, nor the feedback from evaluation of the action, that matters in this case, but rather, the subjective feeling of being able to cope that reduces the stress. Sometimes individuals may achieve the result of coping through helplessness or hopelessness.60 Helplessness is the acquired expectancy that there is no relationship between anything the individual can do and the level of stress. In other words, the individual has no control. However, even when the individual “accepts” that there is no solution, the level of stress may be reduced. It may also be reduced if the helplessness leads to secondary gain and support from society. In such cases, helplessness may function as a coping strategy, and the secondary gain may reinforce and sustain the helplessness condition. Hopelessness is the acquired expectancy that most or all responses lead to a negative result. There is control, and responses have effects, but they are all negative. The negative outcome is seen as personal fault since the individual has control. This conclusion introduces the element of guilt. The second meaning of coping is the coping act – to reduce or eliminate the stress itself by action. When the stressor is a resource constraint, the literature proposes two identifiable coping strategies that humans, who believe they are able to cope with the stressor, are likely to pursue – a simplification-of-focus strategy and a compensation strategy. Simplification-focus coping strategy occurs when humans eliminate unnecessary or less valuable parts of the work process. It can be perceived as analogous to revamping a value-chain, re-engineering a business process or waste elimination in Lean. Simplification is not always a part of the strategy, as people sometimes proceed directly to the focusing action: concentrating on the key components of the work process. A compensation coping strategy involves closing the gap caused by the resource constraint by utilizing coping assets that compensate for the constrained resources. We define coping assets as the skills and capabilities that the organization either possesses or can gain access to and can utilize when dealing with resource constraints [rosenzweig_how_2016].  Unlike the simplification-focus strategy, where people eliminate parts of the work process and focus on the remaining ones, in compensation they add to the work process by utilizing their coping assets. People exploit compensation because the challenge pushes them to optimally utilize the materials, knowledge, people, and other processes that are already available [eisenhardt_making_1989].  Another form of compensation strategy is bricolage. Bricolage refers to  60  [ursin_cognitive_2004]

214 
solving problems and taking advantage of opportunities by combining existing resources [baker_creating_2005]. A great example of this strategy is Kaizen in Lean [sugimori_toyota_1977]. A simplification-focus strategy is exploitative in nature. It entails the exclusion of processes or materials, and thus focuses only on components that are already part of the work process. As such, this strategy limits the ability to achieve benefits that only exist outside the boundaries of the system. A compensation strategy is exploratory in nature. Compared to a simplification-focus strategy, a compensation strategy requires people to add to the existing process and knowledge by borrowing knowledge and resources from outside the closed system, outside the scope of the current work process, even outside the organization. Thus, its impact may extend beyond the boundaries of the stress, i.e., the strategy actually over-compensates because it entails new and meaningful learning opportunities.  Our distinction between the two coping strategies and their associations with exploitative and explorative learning processes is particularly valuable in the context of innovation. The strong link between simplification-focus and exploitative learning indicates that a simplification-focus strategy is likely to lead to incremental innovation. Conversely, the strong link between a compensation strategy and explorative learning indicates that a compensation strategy is likely to lead to radical innovation. Importantly, both coping strategies yield positive innovation performance; the type of innovation, however, is a key dimension that may distinguish between the two strategies. In summary, because a compensation strategy provides a richer toolbox for current and future encounters with challenges, it is superior to a simplification-focus strategy [rosenzweig_how_2016]. Still, a single organization may implement both coping strategies in a case in which managers eliminate non-valuable work process actions through simplification-focus and add valuable actions through compensation. Therefore, despite opposing behaviors, it is possible that the implementation of these two approaches overlaps, as manifested in Lean. An example of how novelty arises from stress, as described above, is the way Honda developed new products, as described by an executive: “It’s like putting the team members on the second floor, removing the ladder, and telling them, jump or else! I believe creativity is born by pushing people against the wall and pressuring them almost to the extreme.” [takeuchi_new_1986] This comes from the article that claimed to be the origin of Scrum: “Scrum for software was directly modeled after ‘The New New Product Development Game’ by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka, published in the Harvard Business Review in 1986.” [sutherland_takeuchi_2011] Another example comes from Ohno: “I strongly believe that necessity is the

## Page 215

 
215 
mother of invention…The key to progress in production improvement, I feel, is letting the plant’s people feel the need.” [ohno_workplace_1988] Let’s take stock and list the necessary -- but not sufficient -- conditions for innovation:  ● Stress caused by a stressor, or a set of stressors, e.g., resource constraints. ● A subjective feeling of being able to cope. ● A perspective shift by borrowing knowledge and resources from outside the closed system, outside the scope of the current work process, even outside the organization itself.  Stress, coping, perspective shift. Remember cognitive activation? Only when the old patterns will no longer survive do we see things differently. So, if we starve people of resources, we actually help them cope --and if we put them close to different sources of knowledge, then they will be wonderfully inventive. A great illustration of this can be found in the movie Apollo 13 [snowden_apollo_2009]. Some things go down into the Clear domain, where, in terms of innovation, things go to die. This isn’t a value statement. Clear may contain 90% of the value of an organization. The point is, we only put things into Clear when we don’t need to change them. If we do need to change them, Clear is a bad place to go [snowden_cynefin_2015].  With human systems, if we impose excessive constraints, sooner or later people will find ways to work around them.  In fact, sometimes the only way to get the job done is to break the rules. That actually is a habitual pattern, an attractor for breaking the rules. The energy consumption of the system actually goes up – it may appear to be efficient on the surface, but the reality is, it’s extremely inefficient. If rules-breaking is an exception, then it works differently. By following a Complexity Thinking-based approach, we would have a few more rigidly enforced rules, and rules about who can break the rules, and when. We also have heuristics, which operate on the other side of the rule boundary.   This is all too common: when faced with complexity, people don’t absorb it but instead try to eliminate it.  The fluidity of complexity is far too scary. Increasingly these days, we find that the level of volatility is such that things never stabilize long enough in any type of regularity, and so we never really get certainty. If that’s the case, we need to stay in the Complex domain while constantly skimming the surface of chaos. That is called a Grazing dynamic [snowden_cynefin_2015]. Different types of problems require different management approaches. For Complex problems, the role of management is to create and relax constraints as

needed, and then dynamically allocate resources where patterns of success emerge. We manage what we could manage – the boundary conditions, the safe-to-fail experiments, rapid amplification, and dampening. By applying this approach, we discover value at points along the way.   Learning and adapting to a complex environment is accomplished by running safe-to-fail experiments, i.e., catalytic probes. Does a “probe” mean a scientific type of experiment? Absolutely not! Probes are not experiments, in the strict 19th-century scientific context. Rather, a probe is an experiment in the more general sense of the word – do something, then see if it works. Experimenting means risk reduction, betting after the horse race has started. With probes, we use the present in order to influence the horse race while it’s still on. Here is how we do a probe. We identify any coherent hypothesis about what could potentially improve things. To agree that our hypothesis is coherent is not the same as agreeing that we are right. Every probe gets a small amount of resources to run a short-cycle, safe-to-fail experiment. The rule is very simple – the experiment must be safe-to-fail. That means if it fails, we’ll be able to recover [snowden_safetofail_2011].  Each probe should be: • coherent • safe-to-fail • finely grained, tangible We run all probes in parallel because we want to stay in the Complex domain. Actually, this is a significant conflict resolution tool, because if we do only one probe in sequence, somebody has to be right.  Therefore, everybody has to emphasize the evidence that supports their proposition to get resources. Hence, they get more and more defensive about it and less and less prepared to think it’s wrong, and so attack other people’s ideas more. That’s when things are binary: in order to win, we have to show that the other side is wrong.  On the other hand, if we say, I don’t agree with you, but I think your idea is coherent, that’s a very different proposition. That way, we can reduce strategic conflict. The heuristic on a portfolio of probes is – over the whole portfolio, if some experiments succeed, then others must fail. Because if all of them can succeed, we are not spreading our senses wide enough. We don’t learn by doing something right.  We learn by making mistakes and correcting them. The point is – if we don’t know what’s going to happen, we need broad expansion. We have to run all the probes, not shut some of them down. That’s because the one that works in the present circumstances this time may not work in other circumstances next time – because the experiments will change the space anyway! In a complex system, every intervention changes the thing observed. It’s not about whether this hypothesis is right – if the hypothesis is coherent, then 

---

## Page 217

 
217 
next time around it may work, because next time around, the butterfly will flap its wings in a different sequence. Overall, the portfolio should contain: • some probes that are oblique in nature • “naive” approaches • a few high-risk/high-return options The first portfolio rule is that at least one of the experiments should be oblique, which means trying to resolve a related, but different, problem. Interestingly, the rule basically concludes: When we are stuck trying to solve a problem, if we forget about it and try to work on something else, we often find a solution for the initial problem.  The second rule is that at least one of the experiments must use a naïve asset. That means getting somebody who has never addressed the problem before, but has deep expertise in a related field, to try to come up with a solution. Creative insights come from people who aren’t wedded to the preconceptions and assumptions that characterize the field. What we are doing here is managing the portfolio of experiments in order to force diversity. As experiments are run, the space will change, and sustainable solutions will become more self-evident. Experiments in this regard are generally fusions. When we run several probes in parallel, they will change the environment anyway -- so the logic is that all probes should be roughly the same size and take roughly the same time to work. As this is a very time-consuming effort, traditional management is likely to fall back into command-and-control mode, as this ostensibly promises to provide for quick and efficient answers [snowden_leader_2007].   Scrum, at least its initial application, is a great example of how to stay in the complex domain while constantly skimming the surface of chaos. As Jeff Sutherland said, “In Scrum, we introduce chaos into the development process, and then use an empirical control harness to inspect and adapt a rapidly evolving system.” [sutherland_Scrum_2008] Scrum was formally presented by its co-creators Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland at the 1995 OOPSLA Conference in Austin, Texas. Their presentation, “SCRUM Development Process,” is still available. Here are some quotes: “The system development process is complicated and complex. Therefore, maximum flexibility and appropriate control is required. Evolution favors those that operate with maximum exposure to environmental change and have optimized for flexible adaptation to change. Evolution deselects those who have insulated themselves from environmental change and have minimized chaos and complexity in their environment.” [schwaber_Scrum_1997] We acknowledge that the above assertions are made on purpose. Because per

Cynefin, we know what chaos, complex and complicated mean.   “The closer the development team operates to the edge of chaos, while still maintaining order, the more competitive and useful the resulting system will be.” [schwaber_Scrum_1997] “Operating at the edge of chaos requires management controls to avoid falling into chaos.” [schwaber_Scrum_1997] Every Scrum practitioner should be able to map Scrum to what we said above.   What Scrum is supposed to do is:  take a set of complex options, probe them in parallel, and spill, as a complicated solution, whatever is ready to be delivered. This cycle is contained in a sprint.   We can see what we are doing here – essentially this is a language of diversity for decision making -- a language not dependent on the individual qualities and training of the leaders. A very important principle here is that Complexity Thinking focuses on interactions and processes, not on individual qualities. Because if we focus on individual qualities, that never scales fast enough to achieve change and is a good excuse for not achieving change. We can always say that people didn’t have the right mindset. (Even though that shouldn’t be a legitimate excuse.) We need to be able to operate with systems where people may not have the right mindset, but still do the right things. An example is the military – their decision-making is based on the assumption that they will work with average people whom they have to train to fight as a unit. We must have processes appropriate for the Cynefin domain we are in. Governing heuristics are, in fact, rigidly enforced processes. There is nothing wrong with that, provided the processes are appropriate to the domain. The problem is, people associate process with Order, but it doesn’t have to be. With humans, rituals, social constraints, and habits become processes.   Chapter 11: Using Cynefin in Projects  Cynefin is a sense-making framework - not a categorization framework. In order to enable sense-making in every unique context, the Cynefin framework is created anew. That is called contextualization. In categorization, the framework precedes the data. In contextualization, the data precedes the framework. As a result, the boundaries between the domains emerge from the data in a social process.

## Page 219

A completed Cynefin framework that is contextualized to the environment and operations of a community, team or organization provides a new shared language with which decision-makers can discuss situations, perspectives, and possible actions. It can be used to talk about interpretations of current conditions based on gathered data, to evaluate strategic interventions, and to constructively manage conflict and bring about consensus, without removing conflict [kurtz_new_2003].  Here, we will use the Cynefin framework to negotiate meaning between Client and Capability contexts when working on a new project [bakardzhiev_adaptable_2016]. The Capability is represented by the delivering organization’s knowledge, skills, and capacity. The value of the contextualized Cynefin framework is that it provides a unique shared language that reflects the context of the project. The Client and the developers can use this language to discuss perspectives and possible actions.  We will create two contextualized Cynefin frameworks – one for the Client, and another for our Capability.   The first thing we need when creating a contextualized Cynefin framework is to write down the user stories to be delivered on hexagon cards. Next, we describe the three ontological Cynefin domains. Then the cards are positioned relative to each corner of the overall Cynefin space – without boundaries. Clusters are allowed to form but are not required. This activity can be done in-person or electronically – but it must be done socially. Discussion is encouraged while placing the cards. This exercise allows us to stop people from saying, “These are the problems; we know about them,” and allows us to say, “These are the problems; frankly, we are not yet clear about them”. Then we let participants decide for themselves what’s in and what’s out of a domain.  The uncertainty about the nature of the Client’s requirements defines the Cynefin domains for the Client’s context. The labels are about “what” options they need to be delivered. Here are three cases: ● The client knows exactly what they need and has already defined it. (Clear) ● The client has a few ideas about what they need. Expert analysis will be necessary to select one alternative and define it. (Complicated) ● The client has a vague idea about what they need and will have to explore many alternatives before arriving at a definition. (Complex)  We draw those labels in the corners on a very large flipchart, as presented on Figure 4, and then talk about the extremes, in the context of the overall purpose

220 
of the project. Then we find three cards that fit at the extremes, and place one card in each of the three corners of our flipchart. Then we select one of the remaining cards at random and place it -- as if it has elastic bonds -- on the three corners. Should it be more like this, or that, or closer to the middle? Again…it’s a group discussion.  Next step:  we take another card at random and place it against the three corners, next to the one we just put down. After that, we keep going until all the other cards are placed. After the initial placement, we never allow to move a card intact, but only by breaking it down into new cards and moving them.  
 Figure 4: Contextualized Cynefin instance: Step 1.  Some caution is in order – when we are doing this, we never give people an example from their own data of what should be in each of the three corners! As complexity thinking facilitators, we realize that people closely watch what we are doing and assume a huge amount of intention on our part. If we want to emphasize an opinion, we choose an example that has nothing to do with their data.   The next step is to define the boundaries, as shown in Figure 5.  When all options are placed, lines are drawn between the user stories that are clearly in one domain, leaving a central area of disorder. Then the lines are “pulled in,” to make the distinctions between domains clearer. If a story is in the central area of 


---

## Page 221

 
221 
disorder, or lies on a line, it is split into two or more user stories that can then be moved to a particular domain. This process involves discussion, as a consensus must be reached.  By defining boundaries, we are not pushing people into categorization.  After the contextualization, then we move into categorization. However, we want to have it without having it prematurely defined.  
 Figure 5: Contextualized Cynefin instance: Step 2.   Cards can stay at a boundary, but not in the central space. The central space is Confused, and we want to get rid of it over time, while we learn more about the nature of what we put in there. Eventually we want to be able to take action, and what is in Confused is not actionable. Typically, the cards that end up in the middle are there because of their improper granularity. The option on the card is too big – part of it may be complex, and another part may be clear. That’s why we can’t tell what kind of option the card really is.  


---

## Page 222

 
222 
 Figure 6: Contextualized Cynefin instance: Step 3.  We take those cards in the middle of the flipchart and break them up into multiple cards. The goal is that each new card will fit into one of the three corners. By reducing the granularity of requirements, needs and capabilities, we allow the cards to combine and recombine more readily, thereby creating more sustainable and resilient projects and activities. The result is shown in Figure 6. This is a two-stage emergence, which is a key that we are breaking things down, recombining them in a different way, and then repeating that process. This is designed to break entrenched thinking, detect new patterns, and gain new perspectives and insights.  Next, we contextualize the same set of options but this time, from a capability perspective. The labels will be different this time, focused on “how” to deliver the options. The uncertainty about whether our development capability would match the requirements defines the Cynefin domains for the Capability context. Again, here

are three examples:  ● We have all the knowledge and skills required to do the job. We do it all the time, in fact. And there is only one way to do it. (Clear) ● We have enough knowledge and skills required to select from the few alternatives about how to do the job. As experts, we’ll research and analyze the alternatives that someone has done before. (Complicated) ● We have none of the knowledge and skills required to do the job. We haven’t done it before, and we’ll need to explore alternatives and build knowledge. (Complex)  Again, we place the cards according to the three corners, as shown in Figure 7. We may not be able to tell if we have the capability to deliver an option, simply because the option itself is not clear enough, from a client perspective. This makes it Complex from a capability perspective as well. As a general heuristic, we need to be conservative and pessimistic. That means that if an option is between Clear and Complicated, we put it in the Complicated corner.

Then we break down the options, which are too big compared to others, as shown in Figure 9.

Eventually, as shown in Figure 10, a Cynefin framework is created anew for each of the Capability and Client contexts.  
   Figure 10: Contextualized Cynefin instance: Step 7.    We will use the contextualized Cynefin frameworks for categorization in the unique context of the project. Our goal is to combine the two perspectives into one perspective that we can use operationally.  Here is how we do that.   First, we create a space with horizontal and vertical axes, as presented on Figure 11. On the horizontal axis, we have the level of constraints from the capability perspective. On the vertical axis, we have the level of constraints from the client context. The level of constraints will be qualitative.

 Figure 11: Complexity space: Step 1.  Being aware of the Cynefin framework, we can easily put labels on both the horizontal and vertical axes.  They map easily to the three Cynefin domains - Clear, Complicated and Complex - as presented in Figure 12. The Chaos domain is also presented on the diagram. It is the point 0, where there are no constraints, neither from  capability nor from the client perspective.

## Page 229

 Figure 14: Complexity profile (CP).  We match the options from each Cynefin framework indexed by their Complexity profile. We do this by taking each of the options and placing them in the respective cell from the Complexity profile. If an option is part of a Complex domain, either from a client or from a capability perspective, it is considered Complex. If an option is part of a Complicated domain, either from a client or from a capability perspective, it is considered Complicated. A Clear domain involves only options that are Clear in both perspectives. Here questions are usually raised:  Why do we need the CP? Why don’t we just place the options in the table as below?   User Story Capability Context Client Context Complexity Profile #1 Complex Clear Complex … … … … #5 Complex Complicated Complex … … … … #14 Clear Clear Clear

## Page 230

 
230 
#15 Clear Complicated Complicated  We don’t use the table above just because we want to show the movement inside the Complexity profile. That would mean making complex options complicated and complicated things clear.  A complexity profile is a maneuverable space. All possible movements among domains are presented below.   
 Figure 15: Three types of systems.  The base movement is to clarify Complex options and make them Complicated. When we have a vague idea of an option, we prepare a concept with a couple of alternatives. In this way, we have made the option Complicated. The movement described represents the accumulation of knowledge about, and also the skills to solve, the problem. This movement is a knowledge discovery process. For example, if we want to move an option from cell CxCx to cell CdCd, we have several alternative routes: ● Linearly CxCx -> CdCx -> CdCd 


---

## Page 231

 
231 
● Linearly CxCx -> CxCd -> CdCd ● Diagonally from CxCx to CdCd, which means we clarify both from capability and from client perspectives  We also see the transition states between the cells presented in stripes. An option is in a transition state when it has left a cell but has not yet gotten into a new cell. That means work is being done to clarify the option.  For example, from a capability perspective, an option is considered complex -- i.e., we don’t know how to implement it and so we decide to develop a Proof of Concept. Then the card will follow CxCx -> CdCx -> CdCd and stay in transition until the PoC provides results.  Another example: if an option is complex from a client perspective, the capability could work with the client by presenting alternatives. This is what we software development experts do -- we provide alternatives, not only about how to do something, but also about what to do. When providing alternatives to the client about what should be done, we have a chance to move the work through the Complexity Profile in a direction that suits best our capabilities as software development experts. One might say that clients who don’t know what they want are the best! We see that the Complexity profile serves as a map to show us how to move rapidly to reach our target position. It helps us act in order to move in two dimensions simultaneously. This dynamic can be presented in a simpler way -- as a movement through a funnel -- as shown in  Figure 16.

## Page 232

 
232 
 Figure 16: Options funnel.  Imagine that we have rotated the complexity profile 45 degrees, so that the lines of movement from Complex to Complicated and then from Complicated to Clear are horizontal. Synthesis is the process of making complex things complicated. Using analysis, we either make the complicated options Clear, or choose one of the excellent alternatives. An example is analyzing how to design a technical system or a user interface.  We see how complex options enter the funnel and come out either as Complicated or Clear following the workflow below. Each option needs to go through synthesis, analysis, and development in order to be ready to be delivered. The discovery process is presented in Figure 17.  


---

## Page 233

 
233 
 Figure 17: Discovery process.  This is how the process works. The first step is to take one option and categorize it. Categorization means placing the option in the proper cell in the Complexity profile. As we saw earlier, the Complexity profile is like a funnel that only Complicated and Clear options can leave.  We can manage the movement of options on an end-to-end Kanban board, as presented in Figure 18. On the right-hand side, we have the upstream Kanban board. Options for new items to be developed enter here. We call them “options” on purpose, to show that it is not mandatory for them to be delivered.

234 
 Figure 18: End-to-end Kanban board.  The left-hand Discovery part of the board tracks exploring options. The right-hand Delivery part of the board tracks promises to deliver. Options may be abandoned but promises must be delivered. On the board, an option can leave the upstream part and enter the Delivery part, either from Analysis or from Clear. Cards in black are clear and can directly enter Delivery.  Let’s not forget that in the Delivery part, we are dealing with requests. Requests should not be canceled, because the delivery system has a limited and expensive capacity. In the Discovery part, we are dealing with options. By definition, options can be abandoned. That is presented in the “Discarded options” area of the Kanban board. The cards in deep grey are Complicated. It is not mandatory that all complicated options should become Clear. A complicated option may enter delivery when it is decided that analysis can be done during delivery. That could happen for two reasons. First, when an option is Clear from a client perspective and Complicated from a capability perspective because there are several alternative ways to implement it. The choice of an alternative can be left to the delivery system. Second, when the option is Complicated from a client perspective because small details have to be decided, e.g., text message content, colors.  They can be cleared during delivery.  An option cannot enter the Delivery part from Synthesis.  Also, a complex option should never exit the funnel because it will clutter up the delivery

process. The delivery system is not supposed to do the work of the discovery system, because the delivery system has no access to the client.  Both analysis and synthesis of an option may require experiments or probes. A probe may be Proof of Concept (PoC).   How do we show on the board that we are probing [ ]  for an option? We put the option card in a transition cell between CxCx and CdCd on the Complexity profile board. Then, a new PoC card is placed in the Problems column. The PoC card follows the Options - Experiment - Review path. If the review provides enough information for the parent option card, then it is moved into a CdCd cell on the Complexity profile. If not, the card stays in transition. It might even be decided to abandon the option. It is also possible on the Complexity profile cards to move “backwards”—say, from Complicated to Complex. For example, we have a Complicated option with a couple of alternatives about what is to be done. The client is considering which alternative to choose when new information from the market arrives;  suddenly, none of the alternatives is viable any more. The client is back to the point where they don’t know what they want. Once again, the option is Complex.  The discovery part of the board that visualizes the Complexity profile is the Kanban system.  The Work in Process (WIP) limits are set at the top of each column. The numbers show the minimum count of options that need to be present at any given time. For instance, the column Synthesis has to have at least 20 options, and go up to 100. Minimum values get smaller as we move to Analysis and Clear because we are operating a funnel. We need many options to enter the funnel, because only a fraction will leave as delivery requests. We see that the funnel requests start at 20, then becomes 10 and ends in 2-5 delivery requests. Why would we want to have 20 Complex options, and only 2–to-5 clear options? Because Clear options are Clear to everybody else, and so are not valuable. We have a pull system on the Discovery side. That means, if we don’t have at least 20 Complex options, we have to find new ones. But the low limit on Clear will prevent us from picking easy-to-find but non-valuable Clear options. We certainly do not  want non-valuable, Clear options to flood the delivery system with non-valuable delivery requests.  For our products, we strive to have the proper combination of Complex, Complicated, Valuable and Clear options. Finally, we establish a regular feedback loop to continuously revisit and update the categorization of both the user stories in-progress, and the newly added user stories.    We need different people to work on different entries in the Complexity

profile. The difference is in the level of complexity they can handle, both from Capability and Client perspectives. For instance – if the problem is clear, then we need a junior person who can simply read a recipe book and follow it. They will need stable requirements, and all the exact tools and technologies from the book. If the problem is Complex, we need a senior person who can cope without a recipe, with changing requirements and whatever is available, in terms of tools and technologies. When we need to adapt, we need more diversity in the system, because then we’ve got more evolutionary capacity. It’s not a coincidence that for living organisms, mutation rates increase under stress – the more diversity, the more adaptability. The requisite diversity is the optimal level of diversity for the context we are in. Diversity means the inefficiency that an organization needs to have. If it is over-focused on efficiency, the organization loses its Adaptive capacity.

Chapter 12 - Using Cynefin with COVID-19 Imagine you were climbing a huge mountain that had  never been explored before. From your starting location, it was impossible to tell which slopes can be traversed and which can’t. It was also clear that most of the terrain is hidden behind the slopes and covered in forest. Your climb involved routes that have been tried and abandoned, and there was backtracking and traversing. Many of the successful decisions you made were pure luck! Eventually you managed to climb the mountain and make it to the summit.  When you look down from the summit, you can scan the terrain, but since it is covered in forest it is impossible to see all of the viable routes, the few good ones, or the best route. If you want to check a possible new route, you have to climb the mountain again! The way we remember highlights of an event is different from the way we experience them during the event. When pressed to explain how you managed to get to the top, you pretend that the route you took was indeed the best one. If we learn retrospectively, it always implies causality. With the benefit of hindsight, you declare that you simply chose that route through logical judgment. That is a lie, of course, because it completely misrepresents the process by which you reached the summit.   It’s only human to rewrite the past with a narrative that replaces luck and experimentation with conscious intent. This is called retrospective coherence, and means that, in hindsight, it's easy to explain why things happened, yet it is impossible to predict ahead of time. Therefore, retrospective coherence cannot be used to act in the present          Fine, but we have to act in the present COVID-19 pandemic. Governments should be responsible for protecting their citizens, so they must take action. But what actions?  As of April 5, 2020, the debate about what to do was  limited to two major alternative opinions.  Do nothing, and let the virus run its course, or use unpopular methods to quarantine, and restrict the movement of citizens within and across city and national borders. Let’s look at the alternatives as presented in the media. First opinions insisted on listening to the experts, who wanted to make a rational decision, based on a logical process backed with reliable data. And what did the experts say? “The data we have is unreliable….Human beings fear what they do not understand, and that fear causes them to behave in irrational and destructive ways....When there is talk about how the virus works, there needs to be actual math behind the statements, and peer-reviewed materials….Lockdown

means we will watch the entire world commit economic suicide, for no good reason....The government should stand back and let the private sector take care of the problem....We have no problem with a strong  central government response -- as long as it is reasonable and wise….OK, many people will die with coronavirus, but this does not mean that they died of it….The authorities may have distorted the figures….It might appear to be far more of a killer than the flu, simply because of the way deaths are recorded. This, of course, explains why such an overwhelming number of Covid-19 deaths involve so-called ‘underlying conditions,’ which are, in fact, serious, often fatal, diseases…. Since there is no reliable data and the models don’t work, if we don’t know what will happen, we shouldn’t do anything extraordinary and simply wait for “herd immunity” to build instead.”  The second opinion is to take the safest possible position. What do those voices say? ….”We are not against collecting more and better data, but decisions can’t wait….Only historians have good data….Decisions must be iterated as more is learned….Only idiots wait for data in a crisis….By the time you have data, it’s too late….We have neither the means nor the time to accumulate such data right now;  decisions must be made….It is like telling a surgeon with his finger on a massive bleeder that he needs lab tests before deciding what to do….Models are only as good as  assumptions….Let’s test and find out! If we had 125 cases 14 days ago, and 5000 today, then the virus grew 40 times during that period…. Certainly, we have more unknown cases…. The modeling forecasts a huge impact on health services. These levels of demand would be completely unprecedented…. Knowing our government, we would consider one or two orders of magnitude more cases than anything that was reported by them…. The idea, advanced by some doctors and politicians, that social distancing is costing the economy too much is a “fake trade-off... The only way to truly help the economy is by snuffing out the pandemic…. We can't wait! Getting more evidence doesn't help, it hurts… In dealing with unexpected events, the most important move is the first move….Timing is everything….We shouldn't take a certain action without good evidence from data, but not taking that action is also a decision that requires evidence…. In the real world, one must reduce risk in the absence of reliable data, via the most robust to perturbations model….Forgetting models for a moment, if we overreact against catastrophic exponential scenarios, we can take a wait-and-see approach, but if we under-react, it will be too late….In the real world, decisions are normally made with insufficient and flawed data…We cannot wait for evidence when people's lives  are at stake.”   Let’s use Cynefin   as a lens to look at the two alternative opinions.  Our goal

is to confirm our perceptions with reality in order to act.  First, what is the Cynefin domain humans perceive we are in? The first group thinks we have to turn to our experts for advice about which good practice to follow. This is a perception of a Complicated situation.  The second group thinks we are in uncharted waters. In order to avoid chaos, we have to act, and our response has to co-evolve with the situation. We have no valid model of how the virus will spread, and how many people will die. Everything is possible! This is a perception of a Chaotic situation.  Second, what is the objective reality? As with any virus, if it is not restrained somehow, the number of COVID-19-infected people will grow exponentially. The virus will mutate, and there will be some attempts to restrain the spread of infection so that the virus and the human population will co-evolve. From the Cynefin perspective, when we hear the term “co-evolve,” we must acknowledge that we are in a Complex system. Waiting for more data is not the way to approach complex, dynamic problems. The Chaos and Complexity domains are not the domains for experts. They flourish in the Complicated domain.  In such a chaotic situation, we have to act, then sense the results and respond accordingly. Speed trumps perfection.  At the same time, we should never forget that the danger in a crisis is premature convergence on a single solution and/or approach. The ability to be decisive while holding many options open is a key leadership ability in a crisis. When taking action, we should differentiate dynamics that we can't affect versus  ones we can affect. We can't keep planets from colliding, but we can keep diseases from exploding -- just by modifying our behavior. Many governments treat the pandemic as if it is an external force on the system that we must respond to proportionally: as it gets worse, we slowly ramp up defensive measures in response to the scale of the force. But it's not an external force, it is an endogenously generated one, and because we grow this force through our behavior, the slow ramping up of mitigation guarantees the expenditure of many more resources across a much longer cycle. Instead, we should have nipped it in the bud.  That’s why the action that could be taken is quite straightforward and has already been done in the history of mankind. It is to isolate, to separate the population in small groups, and then just wait for the virus to die out by itself. After all, the virus doesn’t spread by itself -- it is spread by people!  The extreme version of taking action is to lock down regions, cities, even entire countries. It is clear that, with isolation, the spread of the virus slows down.  Some caution is in order here - if we put rigid constraints that make no sense on people, they will not be obeyed. For instance, we could say that one can go outside  their home at any time, provided they meet no one, compared to the

constraint that one can leave their home  only when the government sends them a text message. Quarantines are imposed to reduce the number of those infected, not to prevent infection. That would be a complex technique. Chaotic situations become complex when we start to see patterns. For complex problems, the role of decision makers is to create and relax constraints as needed, and then to dynamically allocate resources where patterns of success emerge. Examples of constraints are the heuristics: for example, “wear a mask” and “don’t touch your face and mouth.” We manage what we can manage – the boundary conditions, the safe-to-fail experiments, our determination to rapidly amplify or diminish an activity. By using this approach, we discover value at various points along the way. Practices that work in containing the infection should be the result of exaptation, which occurs when, under conditions of stress, something developed for one function is re-purposed for a different function. Nobody will ever know if the Stay-At-Home orders worked.  And to what extent. That’s how complexity works. You can’t know how things might have been otherwise.   We know that with complex systems, whatever we do will produce unintended consequences. The bigger the intervention, the bigger the unintended consequences. Let’s look at some possibilities. First, the public is presented with diagrams where the number of infections grows “exponentially.” That particular diagram must have been familiar to every person signing for a loan with compound interest. Maybe one of the unexpected second-order effects from this crisis would be that people start looking back into the usury question of how compound interest really works.  Second, there may be unintended consequences of fear and stress on citizens’ behavior caused by regulations without reassurance as to consequences.  Third, consequences for the decision makers. Obviously, the lockdowns are the road governments would take globally. There are voices who will want the governments to report -- after the pandemic is over --if the measures taken were the right ones. What if the final numbers of the dead are way below the flu? The public will say that it was fooled, and that we have averted something that was never really going to be as severe as we had feared. Obviously, the governments will say that this is because their repressive economy-wrecking measures worked. The public will demand proof, from a thorough independent inquiry, that this is true.  Because if it is not, then we are in danger of the first global political crisis.  Globalization is reason enough to anticipate a “very strange acute virus spreading throughout the planet.” Calling it black swan allows leaders to excuse

their not being prepared. This year’s COVID-19 virus, however, was a predictable event. COVID-19 is a wake-up call for the human race. Thank God it is not as severe a disease as Ebola is.  Actually, it is giving us a chance to find new and better ways to live and work together. It will not, however, be the last pandemic.  Once you have internalized that thought, it is impossible to believe that we can ever return to the pre-virus world. Everything we do, all of our investments, and even the way we organize ourselves, will be influenced by new considerations. Will we be protected from COVID-19 and its successors, or made more vulnerable to them? As a first step toward confronting the outbreaks that are certain to come, we must learn to live with uncertainty, rather than allowing ourselves to be held captive by it.  Business and other organizations must switch to a different mode of operating. They will have to abandon their usual annual plans and quarterly targets, and instead, pay full attention to any virus situation as it unfolds. And then adjust their behavior accordingly. It’s a skill and a capacity that we urgently need today. In other words, our entire attention and intention need to quickly align with what is actually happening in the present.
