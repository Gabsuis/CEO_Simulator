POC Must-Have Features
(Based on survey and interviews)
1. One-Tap Dictation → Structured Note
• Seamless dictation that instantly transcribes into text.
• Works reliably within the 5–10 minute golden window after session.
• No need for multiple clicks or manual file handling.
Why: Therapists report typing is the biggest friction; dictation saves time 
and maintains therapeutic presence.
Research: Speech recognition reduced documentation time from ~8.9 → 
~5.1 minutes per report (Rosenthal et al., 2025) .
2. Dual-Mode Notes (Progress & Process)
• Progress Notes: concise, SOAP-style, regulatory minimum.
• Process Notes: richer reflection, including themes, emotions, 
countertransference.
• Therapist chooses depth per session/patient.
Why: U.S.-trained therapists emphasized regulatory distinction (Bailey). 
Israeli therapists less formal but want flexibility.
3. Insight Extraction Layer
• Identify topics raised.
• Detect strong emotions and emotional peaks.
• Highlight repeated words and themes across sessions.
• Option for 2–3 sentence summaries (for quick recall or parents).
Why: Both survey (84 therapists) and interviews consistently asked for this.
Research: AI transcription tools can automatically highlight themes and 
generate concise summaries, improving efficiency (Wang et al., 2025; Zhao 
et al., 2025) .

4. Per-Patient Digital Notebook
• Organized by client: one digital notebook per patient.
• Entries automatically filed under correct patient record.
• Free-text field for therapist comments.
Why: Therapists described frustration with searching across generic notes; 
need quick retrieval per client.
5. Security & Compliance First
• No audio storage (text-only transcripts).
• End-to-end encryption (at rest & in transit).
• HIPAA, GDPR, Israeli MoH aligned.
• Consent workflow built-in for transparency.
Why: Every therapist flagged privacy/ethical concerns; refusal to record full 
sessions.
Research: Ethical compliance is critical for clinician adoption; encryption + 
consent are key trust builders .
6. Minimalist, Bilingual UX (HE/EN)
• Clean, distraction-free interface.
• Hebrew + English support.
• Predefined quick-insert points (checkboxes for goals, outcomes, etc.).
Why: Israeli therapists requested Hebrew; all stressed “zero friction.”
7. Customization Beyond Templates
• Adaptive note style that learns therapist preferences.
• Ability to adjust format (SOAP, narrative, free-text mix).
Why: Therapists reject rigid templates; want the tool to fit their personal 
workflow.
Research: Adoption improves when clinicians can tailor output; Value 
Proposition Canvas highlights customization as a driver .

8. Pilot with 18 Design Partners
• Validation with at least 18 therapists in real-world clinical settings.
• Measure:
• Speed of use (<60 sec note entry).
• Comfort with privacy/security.
• Perceived usefulness of insights.
• Consistency of adoption week-to-week.
Why: Internal alignment — pilot cohort needed to shape product fit 
before scaling.
Research: Design partner frameworks (a16z) show early co-creation 
ensures adoption .
