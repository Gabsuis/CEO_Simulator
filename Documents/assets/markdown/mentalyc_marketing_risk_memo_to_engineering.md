## 📩 Internal Memo – Risk Escalation from Marketing

**From:** Marketing Team

**To:** Engineering Team

**Date:** November 5, 2025

**Subject:** Risk Escalation: Launch Delays Due to Lack of Engineering Progress on Website

### 🧭 Context


As of Sprint 2 completion, the Marketing team is unable to move forward with launch activities due to a lack of implementation progress on critical website infrastructure and user-facing features.
Despite clear direction in the approved website briefing and POC documents, no engineering time has been allocated to website setup, content integration, or front-end MVP components.


### ❗ Risks to Company Goals

- 🚨 Inability to launch even a basic marketing site blocks our pilot program and external credibility.

- 🚨 Core product positioning (session-to-note workflow, privacy compliance, dual-mode insights) is not demonstrable without a product UI.

- ⚠️ Design partners and early adopters lack a clear intake path (no CTAs, landing page, demo).

- ⚠️ Delayed engineering visibility creates messaging gaps and missed targeting opportunities.

### 📌 Immediate Needs


Marketing respectfully requests that Engineering immediately scope and prioritize:
1. Initial HTML/CSS/React scaffolding of the website based on the briefing.
2. A low-latency demo experience for the “One Tap → Note” workflow.
3. Feature flags or dummy endpoints to enable simulation for screenshots and copy integration.
4. Consent flow + HIPAA messaging to be surfaced on landing pages.


### 📅 Proposal


We propose the Engineering team create and commit to a parallel 3-sprint website implementation plan with bi-weekly demos to the Marketing + Product team.
The Marketing sprint plan and deliverables are ready and blocked solely by this dependency.


### 📣 Ask

Please confirm readiness to align and initiate a joint workstream in Sprint 3 with weekly working sessions.
