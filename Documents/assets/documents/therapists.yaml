        systems:
          - "Simple EHR with basic calendar and notes"
          - "Google Calendar for personal/family planning"
        waitlist_status: "Waitlisted for 4–6 weeks"
    documentation_habits:
      current_method: "Types her notes manually in the EHR after sessions"
      note_style: "SOAP notes with occasional narrative detail"
      average_time_per_note_minutes: 10
      backlog_pattern: "Frequently leaves 4–6 notes for evenings or weekends"
      typical_behavior: |
        She often writes very minimal notes during the day, relying on her
        memory to “add more later” but most evenings she is too tired to do it.
        On especially emotional days, she procrastinates documentation altogether
        because it feels like reliving the clients’ pain.
      emotional_reaction_to_notes: |
        Notes feel draining and bureaucratic to her. She worries about liability
        if her notes are too thin, yet feels guilty taking time away from her family
        just to type them. There’s a constant guilt loop: she is either behind on
        notes or missing time with family.
    technology_profile:
      tech_comfort_level: "Moderately comfortable but cautious"
      tools_in_use:
        - "Telehealth platform integrated with EHR"
        - "Simple EHR (scheduling, billing, notes)"
        - "Password manager"
      security_concerns: |
        Very sensitive about client confidentiality. Immediately suspicious
        of anything “AI” that might record or store sessions. Needs very clear
        explanations of encryption, storage, and who can access what.
      adoption_style: "Early majority – will adopt new tools if recommended by trusted peers"
    goals_and_motivations:
      primary_goals:
        - "Leave the office with notes done and brain less fried"
        - "Protect evenings and weekends for family"
        - "Reduce the emotional load of writing about trauma all day"
      secondary_goals:
        - "Improve quality and consistency of documentation"
        - "Have better recall for complex cases and long-term clients"
      long_term_vision: |
        She wants to keep a small but full practice, potentially supervise
        a few younger clinicians, and work 4 days per week with sustainable
        energy instead of constant low-level burnout.
    pains_and_frustrations:
      pains:
        - "Documentation feels like emotional re-exposure to trauma"
        - "Spending too many hours after work finalizing notes"
        - "Fear of an audit or legal issue because notes are too brief"
        - "Perpetual feeling of being behind"
      triggers:
        - "Back-to-back trauma sessions with no buffer"
        - "Insurance requests for detailed records"
        - "Receiving EHR emails reminding her of unfinished notes"
      key_quote: |
        "I love my clinical work. I hate the feeling of sitting in a dark office at
        8 pm, typing about trauma when my kids are already in bed."
    relationship_to_menatlyc_like_tool:
      awareness_level: "Heard about AI note tools in a Facebook therapist group"
      initial_reaction: |
        Curious but wary. She worries about client consent, privacy,
        and whether the AI will “capture the soul” of the session or
        just generate generic CBT phrases.
      main_objections:
        - "Is this legally safe and HIPAA-compliant?"
        - "Will my clients feel weird being recorded?"
        - "What if the AI gets something clinically important wrong?"
      key_needs_for_adoption:
        - "Clear legal and ethical framing she can defend to her licensing board"
        - "Easy-to-understand explanation for clients about recording and consent"
        - "Proof that she can still edit and keep clinical nuance"
      ideal_experience_description: |
        She imagines ending the day with all notes drafted already, only needing
        a quick review and tweak. She wants to feel like the tool “was in the room
        with her,” capturing themes, risk statements, and interventions so she can
        focus on the human being instead of remembering exact wording.
    buying_journey:
      discovery_channels:
        - "Therapist Facebook group recommendation"
        - "Podcast ad on a therapy-related show"
      decision_influencers:
        - "Peers who already use the tool"
        - "Her consultation group’s opinion on ethical implications"
      trial_behavior: |
        She would likely start with a free trial on a subset of clients,
        testing note quality, client reactions to being recorded, and how
        editing feels. If the tool reduces her after-hours work even by 50%,
        she’s inclined to convert to a paid plan.
      price_sensitivity: "Moderately price sensitive – will pay if it clearly saves time and energy"
      churn_risks:
        - "If privacy or security feels unclear or changes"
        - "If editing AI notes ends up taking as long as writing herself"
        - "If clients voice discomfort with recordings"

        - "Setting up systems and SOPs"
        - "Watching cash flow, payroll, and marketing"
    documentation_habits:
      personal_notes_method: "Uses EHR templates and types quickly"
      team_documentation_challenges: |
        Associates vary wildly in note quality and speed. Some are late,
        some write overly detailed process notes, others are too brief for
        insurance expectations. Alex spends real time chasing notes and
        coaching on documentation.
      operational_pain_points:
        - "Unbilled sessions due to missing notes"
        - "Inconsistent documentation standards across the team"
        - "Anxiety around potential audits from payers"

        - "Practice management dashboards"
        - "Slack or similar tool for internal communication"
        - "Basic automation (intake forms, reminders, etc.)"
      innovation_mindset: |
        Alex sees technology as leverage. They’re constantly asking,
        “How do we scale good care without burning people out?” They’re willing
        to try tools if they can be standardized across the team.
    goals_and_motivations:
      business_goals:
        - "Standardize documentation quality across all clinicians"
        - "Reduce unbilled sessions and delayed claims"
        - "Make the practice attractive to hire and retain clinicians"
      clinical_culture_goals:
        - "Keep clinical autonomy while building consistent standards"
        - "Reduce burnout and resentment around admin tasks"
        - "Create a sense of ‘supported, not surveilled’ systems"
    pains_and_frustrations:
      pains:
        - "Chasing clinicians for late notes"
        - "Reconciling missing documentation with billing"
        - "Balancing empathy for tired staff with financial realities"
      emotional_state: |
        Alex often feels stuck between being the “good, understanding boss”
        and the person responsible for making sure the business stays solvent.
        Documentation is the arena where this conflict shows up most.
      key_quote: |
        "Every late note is basically money stuck in limbo, but I also know my team
        is exhausted. I need a way to make this lighter, not just more policing."
    relationship_to_menatlyc_like_tool:
      primary_interest: |
        Less in personal convenience, more in scalable systems: can this tool
        help 5–10 clinicians write faster, better notes with less oversight?
      use_cases:
        - "Standardized note templates across the practice"
        - "Guided summaries so associates don’t miss key clinical or risk details"
        - "Faster completion so billing is not held up"
      implementation_questions:
        - "How does pricing work per clinician?"
        - "Can I have an admin/owner view of note completion metrics?"
        - "Can we set templates or rules for how notes should look?"
      perceived_risks:
        - "Clinicians feeling micromanaged or overly monitored"
        - "Onboarding complexity for a team with mixed tech comfort"
        - "Clients pushing back on recording policies"
      adoption_requirements:
        - "Clear onboarding path for multiple clinicians"
        - "Training materials they can integrate into staff meetings"
        - "Compliance documentation suitable for audits and risk management"
    buying_journey:
      discovery_channels:
        - "LinkedIn post targeted at group practice owners"
        - "Presentation or workshop at a group practice conference"
        - "Word-of-mouth from other practice owners"
      decision_criteria:
        - "ROI at the practice level, not just individual"
        - "Ability to monitor note completion and quality at a glance"
        - "Ease of rollout to 5–10 clinicians"
      decision_making_process: |
        Alex would likely test the tool personally for a few weeks,
        pilot it with 1–2 interested clinicians, gather feedback, then decide
        whether to roll it out across the practice. They will examine numbers:
        time-to-note, note completion rate, and billing delays before and after.
      churn_risks:
        - "If clinicians refuse to use it or find it too clunky"
        - "If it doesn’t meaningfully reduce admin time or billing delays"
        - "If customer support for multi-clinician setups is poor"

    documentation_habits:
      training_background: |
        Jordan was trained to write thorough progress notes, partly out of anxiety
        about “doing it wrong.” In practice, this has turned into lengthy
        narrative notes that take too long and still feel disorganized.
      current_method: "Writes notes directly in the telehealth platform after each session"
      average_time_per_note_minutes: 12-15
      backlog_pattern: |
        Often writes “bullet reminders” during sessions, then batches final notes
        late at night. Sometimes ends weeks with a backlog of 15+ notes, which
        spikes anxiety and disrupts sleep.
      relationship_to_notes: |
        Documentation is a major impostor-syndrome trigger. Jordan worries that
        supervisors or a future auditor will see the notes and decide he’s not
        “real therapist material.” This causes perfectionism and over-writing.
    technology_profile:
      tech_comfort_level: "High – grew up with tech, no fear of apps"
      tools_in_use:
        - "Video telehealth platform with integrated notes"
        - "Task manager app for to-dos"
        - "Cloud storage for personal materials"
      experimentation_style: |
        Will try almost any tool for a month if it looks cool or promises
        less stress. But he will drop it quickly if it adds friction or feels
        confusing. Short attention span for confusing UX.
    goals_and_motivations:
      professional_goals:
        - "Feel more confident and efficient as a clinician"
        - "Develop a sustainable rhythm for telehealth work"
        - "Avoid burnout and all-nighters"
      personal_goals:
        - "Have evenings free for friends, hobbies, and dating"
        - "Reduce anxiety about getting “in trouble” for documentation"
    pains_and_frustrations:
      pains:
        - "Constant sense of running behind"
        - "Difficulty switching off his brain at night because of unfinished notes"
        - "Shame spiral about not being as ‘on top of it’ as other clinicians"
      key_quote: |
        "My brain is fried after screen sessions all day. The last thing I want
        to do is stare at the screen even longer to write the 'perfect' note."
      burnout_risk: "High – overworks to compensate for insecurity"
    relationship_to_menatlyc_like_tool:
      attraction_points:
        - "Promise of faster, structured notes"
        - "Clear prompts or summaries so he doesn’t forget what happened in session"
        - "Ability to learn what a ‘good enough’ note looks like"
      psychological_dynamics: |
        For Jordan, the tool is not just about time; it’s about self-trust.
        If the AI produces clinically reasonable notes that supervisors accept,
        it becomes a confidence booster. If it’s too rigid, he might feel judged
        by the tool itself.
      top_questions:
        - "Will my supervisor consider AI-assisted notes acceptable?"
        - "Can I still adjust the language to reflect my style?"
        - "Do I have to record the whole session, or can I just upload parts?"
      objections:
        - "Worry that AI might miss nuance in emotionally complex couples sessions"
        - "Anxiety about explaining recording to anxious or suspicious clients"
      adoption_requirements:
        - "Very simple onboarding, with a ‘start here’ guide"
        - "Examples of notes that passed supervision or insurance standards"
        - "Reassurance that editing is expected and normal, not a failure"
    buying_journey:
      discovery_channels:
        - "Instagram or TikTok ads aimed at younger therapists"
        - "Recommendations from therapist Discord/Slack communities"
        - "YouTube reviews or walkthroughs"
      trial_behavior: |
        Jordan is likely to sign up impulsively for a free trial after
        watching a short, compelling demo video. If the first 2–3 sessions
        feel significantly easier to document, he will stick around. If the
        UX is confusing, he will abandon quickly.
      price_sensitivity: "High – early-career income, student loans, low savings"
      churn_risks:
        - "If monthly cost feels too high relative to income"
        - "If he changes jobs or platforms and forgets to re-integrate the tool"
        - "If supervisors express skepticism about AI-generated drafts"
